<p>Life is beset with good and bad, health and disease. No living being is free from health problem at one time or other. Medical science can diagnose the disease only when it occurs. Prevention from diseases, like the communicable and epidemic diseases, is possible by taking preventive measures in time. It is only astrology, numerology (not name numerology, which is not a science) and palmistry that can warn about a pending disease. The life of living creatures, particularly that of humans, is governed by the planetary influences, which can be read from the horoscope and Gochara.</p>


<p>The effect of planets on each sign, house and on each other plays an important role on the health in general and on particular organs.

Some chronic or permanent disabilities occur in accordance with the placement of malefic planets in certain positions. Occasional physical disabilities and disturbances occur due to the astrological factors in time and space. The signs in the zodiac, the planets and the houses considered from moon sign have their own pecularities pertaining to certain organs.

As Karma is not a fatalistic path, there are ways and means to mend Karma with Shanti Karmas. Take courage, be optimistic and consult those who can give proper guidance for spiritul remedies to ward off the malefic effects of planets, ordained by destiny due to Karma.</p></div>

                    <p>There has been a lot of confusion to the fact whether Sayan system is right or Nirayan. Though being a major difference, yet it has not been well understood. Here, in this article, we try to clarify that the planets in the sky are moving according to Nirayan system, and hence only the nirayan system should be followed in astrology. Sayan system is merely meant for knowing the earth's position with respect to Sun and thus determining the seasons but it is not meant for knowing which planet is passing through which sign.</p>
