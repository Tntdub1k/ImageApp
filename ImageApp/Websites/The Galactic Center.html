<h1><strong><em>The Galactic Center </em></strong> </h1>
<p>It's true, Pluto now aligns with the Galactic Center and will through all 
  of 2007 and 2008. Following is an excerpt from <em>The Soul of the Sky</em>, 
  one of the many components of my <em>Galactic Trilogy CD</em>. This article

<p>Our solar system spirals and pinwheels its way about the powerful center of 
  the galaxy. The Sun maintains the same relationship to the Galactic Center as 
  the Earth does to the Sun. The Sun revolves about the Galactic Core taking roughly 
  240 million years to accomplish the task. Some 30,000 light years from center 
  and slightly south of the Galactic equator, our Sun resides in between the two 
  arms of the galaxy, the Perseus Arm and the Sagittarius Arm. To view the Galactic 
  Center, we must look through the Sagittarius Arm, also known as the Southern 
  Stream. This stream contains a proliferation of galactic players such as stars, 
  pulsars and the like, justifying the greater amount of stars and energy underwriting 
  the signs of Scorpio, Sagittarius and Capricorn (Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius, 
  if seen sidereally).</p>
<p>The Galactic Center recently received verification that it contains a black 
  hole as its center. The resulting energy squeeze emits a wide array of powerful 
  radiation, most notably infrared (IFR) in this instance. This Infrared energy 
  pressures the subconscious mind, providing the release of learned behavior and 
  memories, both negative and positive, all in the interest of moving forward. 
</p>
<p>The energetic crowding process pushes out mentally/emotionally stored data 
  to clear space for new information to enter both the conscious and subconscious 
  minds. Often the information released does not follow a sequential pattern. 
  Holes are left in one's data field. Access time to known information and stored 
  memory increases. So periodically, it becomes time to rearrange life&#8217;s 
  data and re-pack it. For a technical analogy, run the program Defrag on an IBM 
  clone computer or its Apple equivalent. Observe the procedure the computer uses 
  to effectively utilize empty space and reestablish accessing efficiency. At 
  the end of the hard drive Defrag, all available storage capacity waits at the 
  ready for the next inflow of information. To boot, the access time to stored 
  information decreases.</p>
<p>Those with connections to the Galactic Center benefit from the same basic maintenance 
  agenda one devotedly applies to their computer. Logically, it makes sense to 
  apply the same respectful, regularly scheduled regard to the self, which is 
  the source of knowledge. Every now and then a review of what is known, serves 
  the Z personality. The first step consists of reviewing information to observe 
  what knowledge became superseded by new information. Should the new information 
  nullify the old thinking, then delete all obsolete ideas. If the new information 
  simply augments the previous information, then enhance and update the knowledge/wisdom 
  files. This would be similar to Einstein reporting to the scientific world that 
  E = mc2. While Einstein&#8217;s equation did not violate Newton&#8217;s physical 
  laws, it did adjust the application of those laws. A new context or dimension 
  for the knowledge, both former and newer, resulted. Then there&#8217;s the idea 
  of completely fresh information with no relevance (at least yet) to what is 
  already known. Add this, too.</p>
<p> First, though, the process of psychic defragging remains. One must identify 
  obsolete, wrong or undesired segments of information and knowledge. These need 
  to be deleted. Deleted means wiped from the consciousness with no trace. Again, 
  computer metaphors serve our purposes. You can delete a file and toss it to 
  the recycle bin where it floats in informational purgatory. This file is not 
  really present, nor is it totally gone. It does waste space. It gets in the 
  way. On those glitch computer days wildly fanned by rich solar flares, Mercury 
  retrograde or what have you, these files can even block proper access to the 
  good, current, helpful, progressive information.</p>
<p>The mental process can be as simple as defining the undesired thinking and 
  making a conscious effort to shunt it. An exercise that works well is the &#8220;I 
  Get To Be Wrong About...&#8221; drill. On a sheet of paper write, &#8220;I get 
  to be wrong about,&#8221; across the top. Now add the statements of fact you 
  wish to intellectually eradicate. This looks like, &#8220;I get to be wrong 
  about that fact that...&#8221; The second part fills in the faulty beliefs previously 
  maintained. These fractured concepts can deal with any area of life. For instance: 
  &#8220;the fact that men are not sensitive or don&#8217;t listen,&#8221; &#8220;the 
  fact that I can&#8217;t make enough money being spiritual,&#8221; &#8220;the 
  fact that sex in relationship wanes after six months (or your favorite interval),&#8221; 
  &#8220;the fact that the world cannot live in peace,&#8221; or &#8220;the fact 
  that people will never understand the vital life-force energy of the soul,&#8221; 
  all offer examples. Documenting these ideas brings them out of the subconscious 
  into the conscious. If you&#8217;re not sure what failed beliefs you have, make 
  up one to suit any recurring obstacle you encounter in life.</p>
<p>After the deletion exercise is done, do the creed-building exercise. With deliberate 
  attention, possibly over a series of efforts, define what you do intend to carry 
  within your consciousness as an active, contributing belief. Make these specific, 
  open-ended and clear. </p>
<p>This effort takes care of the mental element. Sometimes, though, the psyche 
  insists upon clinging to old beliefs because its need for stability. It confuses 
  familiarity with good. To address this part of the problem, the psychology and 
  ego must be superseded. This becomes an energy evolution.</p>
<p>The IFR vibration strongly emanated by the Galactic Center, jostles the Root 
  Chakra, one of the seven primary energy centers of the body according to Eastern 
  Mysticism. The Root Chakra serves as a discharge point of one's vibrational 
  nature connecting it with the Earth while acting as a turnaround for the kundalini, 
  the snake-like spiraling coil of energy connecting all seven chakras with the 
  Source. Kundalini in a totally integrated individual serves to weave all aspects 
  of the person together. Complete creativity, unlimited capacity for healing, 
  uninhibited creativity, total passion for life, Divine Love, Divine Understanding 
  and infinite potential make up the by-products of kundalini. From this description 
  it makes sense for everyone to sign for this energetic access. For kundalini 
  to completely engage, the presence of the Root Chakra must be noted, activated 
  and honored. A strong point of energetic power, the Root Chakra often receives 
  deferring messages because it&#8217;s in such a sensitive and scary region of 
  the body. Actually, this chakra deals with power and energetic potency, not 
  sexuality. Avoiding attention to this vital energy center shunts energy overall 
  and decreases the natural cosmic river within - and as regarding the Galactic 
  Center, one cheats oneself out of valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>The Galactic Center&#8217;s infrared jolt to the energy field naturally induces 
  the release of past memories that preclude an individual from making progress 
  in life. Consciousness constipation passes. Often, when an emotional download 
  of healing data completes, the body sometimes follows with its own symptoms 
  of letting go. Ranging from shaking, chills and even the elimination system 
  moving into high gear, verification for the inner evolution appears.</p>
<p>New emotional experiences may now replace previously retained ones. The mental 
  barriers to understanding a new idea, receiving insight or just plane old &quot;getting 
  it&quot; gracefully yield under this influence. How is this process stimulated? 
  Several possibilities exist. Good, old-fashioned meditation does the trick. 
  However, as with so many galactic points, the meditative process offers so much 
  more when maintaining a grounded quality. Simply sitting upon the ground, tail 
  bone connected with Earth does the trick. Mediation, if not grounded, does not 
  support the Galactic Center. In fact, disconnected spiritual exercises make 
  access to galactic points more difficult to integrate - especially this one.</p>
<p>The antidote to meditation comes through conscious channeling. Conscious channeling 
  is exactly that: conscious. There&#8217;s no place to go, no spirit guide to 
  meet, no specific state of consciousness to achieve. Naturally, you possess 
  instant access to the download of Divine Insight located at this specific frequency 
  and direction in space at any time, and in blasts taking only fractions of a 
  second. You do not even need to go through the added effort of figuring when 
  the Galactic Center is overhead - which it is once a day. You simply need to 
  clear your mental decks, set the agenda and then do the hardest part of any 
  spiritual exercise: Listen.</p>
<p>Often asking a question helps. Since the information freely rendered by the 
  Galactic Center tends to be very progressive, emotionally confrontational and 
  far out, perhaps a non-personal question serves the process better. </p>
<p>Without going anywhere in intentionally altered consciousness, with eyes open, 
  senses alert, track the flow of information. A stream of consciousness begins. 
  This stream rivals the energy of an arm of a galaxy. It&#8217;s rich, strongly 
  logical and precisely wise. No vagueness occurs in the Galactic Center. The 
  information is incisive, direct, informative. If you experience wandering dialogues 
  or thin responses, your inner tracking dish needs a nudge to firm up on the 
  exact degree. It would not yet be precisely aligned.</p>
<p>Should one be tracking the Galactic Center, physical sensations often accompany 
  the flow of information. These sensations confirm the accuracy and relevance 
  of the content. To ease one's uncertainty about new information, the Galactic 
  Center grants the following classic physical signatures: itching scalp, burning 
  in the palms, gurgling stomach, heat in the back of the neck or at the base 
  of the spine, pressure on the temples of the head and overall tingling. Sometimes 
  a light-headed feeling like that experienced after consuming an excessive amount 
  of sugar or caffeine confirms the tracking.</p>
<p>This information needs documentation. You could write it down. Usually, the 
  flow is so furious that you lag behind in the physical writing process. Recording 
  it works. The use of video or audio devices captures everything. For those up 
  to speed with voice recognition software on the computer, this method works 
  especially well. Grasp it all without losing a lick.</p>
<p>The information provided by the Galactic Center often accurately addresses 
  knowledge factors to which you have never had any exposure. Regardless, the 
  information stands correct. When the data deals with unfamiliar, conscious, 
  instructive knowledge factors than those to which you have been exposed, it 
  leans toward a block diagram view. Heavily conceptual, it&#8217;s a powerful 
  starting point. Make a course outline from the informational flow. It will flesh 
  out later. For things you already know to some degree, the Galactic Center gets 
  very specific. Detail it fully. Don&#8217;t miss a single lick. As with most 
  galactic connections, if you replicate the exact environment you were in, it 
  does not guarantee the idea can return. These surges come through periodic portals. 
  If you return at a time when the portal is bound tight, nothing can come out 
  of it. Use it at the time. Waste wisdom not.</p>
<p>Only one problem exists within Galactic Center information. It&#8217;s slightly 
  ahead of its time.</p>
<p>The good news about the consciousness &#8220;lead&#8221; offered by the Galactic 
  Center is that it&#8217;s at least workable. You can see that down the road 
  this will work, though not immediately applicable. Typically, Galactic Center 
  information leads by six to nine months time. Ideas you get from this nucleus 
  today make sense to the collective consciousness and mainstream ideas of plain, 
  old folks in a half year to a human gestation cycle later. Implement some patience. 
  Your idea flow is like a well thrown pass by a football quarterback. The receiver 
  only needs to catch up with it and run under it to have it perfectly plop into 
  his &#8220;soft&#8221; hands.</p>
<p>Should you want immediate relevance in the real world, review your galactic 
  wares. If you go back to the insights and ideas that others shunned during the 
  last six months to a year, you&#8217;ll find hidden gold consciousness nuggets 
  lying on the ground, shining in the Sun. It&#8217;s as simple as readdressing 
  a previous idea. </p>
<p>If you do not claim the idea as your own, nor assure that it makes it on the 
  agenda once again, someone else will restate your idea. Worse, they&#8217;ll 
  act like they derived the inspiration you downloaded long before. Their subconscious 
  finally got around to processing it, and you enacted the inspiration. They moved 
  through their own resistance and now think it&#8217;s the ultimate ice cream 
  of ideas. Should you have no documentation of your insights, you also have no 
  claim.</p>
<p>Resistance naturally buffets against the Galactic Center flow. Progress is 
  terrifying. Letting go of old concepts, regardless of their flaws, does not 
  come easily. New-fangled ideas might bring some sort of curse with its blessing. 
  Perhaps it&#8217;s better to wait and see. These time-dilated innovations pressurize 
  the comprehension abilities of others to the insights carried by the Galactic 
  Center endowed person. This comprehension lag intensifies if the recipient of 
  the new information holds any emotional investment to previously held ideas. 
  An important concept in scientific research notes that if one conducting an 
  experiment is not willing wrong about the hypothesis underwriting the experiment, 
  the experiment most likely leads to an inevitable failure based in mental bias.</p>
<p>Typically, the response of another to the nothing less than brilliant insights 
  of the Galactic Center will be, &quot;So you're saying I'm wrong. Right?&quot; 
  Not at all, but it can be taken that way. The point is: a different direction 
  exists. A direction that holds more promise, a clearer path, fewer obstacles, 
  focused progress and greater ease now stands before you for your acceptance. 
  &quot;Yeah, well, I'm still not interested.&quot; Of course not. And you're 
  not likely to be until six to nine months from now when you're going to come 
  back, talk about all this and act like you thought of it. No matter. At least 
  it gets done.</p>
<p>Two ways of using the Galactic Center insights effectively exist. One, when 
  imparting information to others who have an emotional charge about what's going 
  on, give it out as if it has nothing to do with them or their situation. Let 
  them grow into it. You have done your part by dispersing the information. Two, 
  keep a log of your Galactic Center based insights. Keep them on high alert status, 
  awaiting the call of a more receptive humankind.</p>
<p>Part of the mental resistance originates in a mnemonic overload condition I 
  like to refer to as psycho-technological adjustment (much to the chagrin of 
  editors). &quot;There already are enough good words in the English language,&quot; 
  an editor once reported to me. &quot;If God had wanted us to fly, he would have 
  given us wings.&quot; &quot;A baby made in a test tube, ain't really a baby.&quot; 
  The truthful point of all similar statements to those above is that they are 
  biased. Full of prejudice and preconceived notions, one cannot move forward 
  in life with an open mind (or heart). It's okay, though. The Galactic Center 
  intends to heal those woes.</p>
<p>Psycho-technological adjustment points out the emotional perplexity of responding 
  to advances in science and technology. How does it strike you that another one 
  of you can be created from what you left behind on the floor of the barbershop 
  or beauty salon? Sex is now redundant since sperm to egg fusion occurs inside 
  test tubes, not to mention cloning. What does that do? What happens when people 
  realize that natural acts and qualities presumably granted through the Will 
  of God can be done without the sanctity allegedly required? What happens if 
  we mess with Mother Nature? By damming up the Colorado River, water comes freely 
  to Arizona and Southern California, but the river&#8217;s natural life cycle 
  fails because of the lack of natural flooding. Some life forms face extinction, 
  never to reside again on this planet. Big deal, right? Maybe not. The Galactic 
  Center issues a technical warning in the form of an uneasy feeling in the guts. 
  This visceral reaction wants to provoke pure futuristic thinking and conceptual 
  ability. Keeping the large view of evolution and progress hand in hand becomes 
  the social, economic, theological and political platform of the Galactic Center.</p>
<p>Most importantly remember: The Galactic Center rules ignorance. Ignorance in 
  this context does not denote a lack of knowledge. Ignorance connotes the presence 
  of knowledge one consciously chooses to ignore. Deliberate deletion of Divinely 
  inspired data defines a sin. Sin, by original denotation, means: &quot;distance 
  from God,&quot; or &quot;missing the mark.&quot; Certainly missing the mark 
  weighs heavily upon the source full of heart within the Sagittarian Archer.</p>
<p>Another more esoteric element exists in this same idea. To ignore the flow 
  of information pouring from the Galactic Center is to ignore one of the Creator&#8217;s 
  loudspeaker systems. Shunning the knowledge indicates complete disrespect and 
  disregard for the Power of it All, whatever that is. Yet, from this source, 
  the information unendingly and undauntedly flows. But it does make you wonder 
  if things today would have been different had Moses doused out the flames of 
  the Burning Bush with water collected from the Red Sea?</p>
<p>The Galactic Center carries the innate ability to single-handedly relieve the 
  dreaded Sagittarian Syndrome. This malady best waves its ugly head when you 
  sit next to a Sagittarian type watching television during a heavily commercialized 
  time slot. The Sag will report, with great enthusiasm, all of his or her missed 
  opportunities in life wherein they thought of the product advertised. &quot;Gosh, 
  they exclaim, &#8220;I had that idea at least five years ago.&quot; And the 
  point is: nothing was done with the information you received.</p>
<p>The Galactic Center radiates brilliant insight to anyone connected with it. 
  This insight craves implementation. This infrared information reveals how to 
  let go of what is in the way to make a clear path for the next step. As soon 
  as an idea is grasped and brought forward, the path of accessing new information 
  refreshes. At all times, new and newer insights spew forth. This carries the 
  tone of consciousness evolution. The collective aim refocuses and retargets 
  with higher and clearer insights at each minute in timelessness. The more considered, 
  the broader the band of consciousness acceptance, then the more assurance can 
  be taken with the focus of life, personal or collective. All this, by the way, 
  occurs a step at a time. One step leads to the next and so on. Extreme long 
  range vision does not accompany these insights. You will not know how far the 
  idea will go, how much it can change the world or your consciousness. This lack 
  of viewing actually protects the ego from going overboard in a Sagittarian agenda 
  - with either extreme overestimation or underestimation.</p>
<p>For an individual with strong Galactic Center connections, several important 
  ideas emerge around the information received. First, the information is free 
  and available to anyone choosing the frequency, whether astrologically linked 
  or not. Whoever uses it first, gets the kudos, accolades and profits. Within 
  the unlimited source of the Galactic Center, there exists a steady, unfailing, 
  unending stream of ideas. Often in Hollywood scripts concepts get guarded with 
  Pentagon-rivaling security efforts. Yet, again, everyone is writing the same 
  script at the same time. A plethora of ideas exists. Therefore, territoriality, 
  propriety and competition seem ridiculous to the wise ways of the Galactic Center. 
  The energy applies to anyone willing to &#8220;listen&#8221; to the energetic 
  band. Enough good ideas exist for everyone choosing to listen.</p>
<p>So the other person got his script about the subjugation of Inuit Indians in 
  Alaska done first. Did they steal your script about the Indians scratching out 
  a living making scrimshaw? No, but they got the deal. Write a different story. 
  But write it, instead of complaining about your missed boat. Sue the other writer 
  for stealing your idea? Not necessary if you have not documented your Galactic 
  Center idea file. And if you have, there&#8217;s no point anyway. Your energy 
  can be better directed in creative thrusts.</p>
<p>In mundane realms the Galactic Center maintains its place. Most typically the 
  Galactic Core carries strong influence in technological breakthroughs. Usually 
  the GC does not bear much influence in natural events: earthquakes, volcanoes, 
  floods and the like, unless a major technological consideration results. If 
  the latest technology in bridge building fell short under the stress test of 
  seismic activity, then the GC may play a part.</p>
<p>When the Wright Brothers successfully flew their mechanized aircraft on the 
  beaches of North Carolina in December 1903, the Galactic Center constituted 
  the midpoint of the Sun/Uranus conjunction in late Sagittarius. So, the Galactic 
  Center perpetually plays a part in aviation, especially where existing technology 
  fails and new engineering must result. Consider that when Uranus, hand-in-hand 
  with Saturn, crossed these degrees in the late 1980's commercial aircraft manufacturers 
  toyed with new ways of engine propulsion. They went back to turboprop bearing 
  Saturn&#8217;s link to the past. But now they put the engines in a new place, 
  at the rear of the plane to honor Uranus. But to give the Uranus return of modern 
  flight extra consideration, the propellers took residence on the rear of the 
  engines. These ideas, though, never really got off the ground. </p>
<p>When Neptune slipped by these critical aviation degrees, two things occurred. 
  First, new engines did arrive for the state of the art aircraft. Notably, these 
  engines produced relatively little noise, minimizing the problems of noise pollution, 
  a Neptune factor. Secondly, these engines implemented previously unknown levels 
  of fuel efficiency, another Neptune push. </p>
<p>In the second half of 2001 as Chiron crossed the Galactic Center, more aviation 
  manifestations arose. Chiron bears the heavy title as the healer who wounds. 
  During this transit, commercial aircraft typically regarded for safely bringing 
  people to their destinations became weapons in a yet undeclared religious war. 
  As the jetliners plummeted into the World Trade Center buildings, a philosophical 
  and physical attack was launched using the most ingenious weapons imaginable. 
</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps when Pluto arrives at these degrees in 2007 and 2008, flying 
  into the darker vastness of the skies will become a practical reality. Maybe 
  we will find out if the top-secret Aurora aircraft capable of doing the United 
  States to Australia in a few hours does exist. Of course, such high altitude 
  flight, for those first embarking upon it, certainly offers an expanded view 
  of the world. Perhaps all the world leaders obsessed with boundaries and physical 
  demarcations on the planet should fly on these aircraft first.</p>
<p>The Galactic Center seeks to destroy prejudice of all kinds. Boundaries around 
  countries disappear when viewed from high-tech space platforms. Sexual attitudes 
  seem moot when life creation originates in a test tube. Evolution bias eases 
  when a primate's blood provides a vital, life-saving serum. Physical excuses 
  for not traveling somewhere release with new developments in transportation. 
  A world wide web site destroys the complaint that one can never have global 
  impact. Virtual reality dissipates the sense that one can never safely overcome 
  the fear of heights. </p>
<p>Ultimately, an understanding of consciousness offers itself to humanity as 
  Pluto reaches to the Galactic Center. Yes, this has happened before. But this 
  time we know about Pluto. And this time we&#8217;ve expanded our physical awareness 
  to include the invisible energy spectrums. </p>
<p>Tolerance exudes from the Galactic Center. This point knows there exists no 
  single, correct answer. Overcoming bias must result. The strength of one&#8217;s 
  prejudice, hatred and fear only indicates a dismal &#8220;You Are Here,&#8221; 
  progress marker on the potential for human consciousness. Simply, sit and listen. 
  Learn to receive the subtle essences of Heaven. Let the inspiration feed you 
  the ways of making wisdom work within the everyday walking within the world. 
  Of course, remember to clear the pier before offloading new goods from the freighter 
  of previously foreign wisdom.</p>
<p>The Galactic Center points out several critical initial factors for us all. 
  First, agree to not see things the same way. Second, realize that all these 
  points of view bear a common thread to the same source of inspiration. Third, 
  redefine the fundamental human needs from all of this. People, in general, require 
  the freedom to receive, perceive and believe in what ever way suits them. People 
  insist upon the right of creating their own belief. </p>
<p>With all of this commonality out of the way, the surges of the rich inspiration 
  of the Galactic Center can once again be felt.</p>
<p>According to the non-ending energy of the Galactic Center, progress is at hand. 
  Progress is always at hand.</p>
