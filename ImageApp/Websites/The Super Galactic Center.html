<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">with 3U 1228+12, Vir A, ZS, M-87, NGC 4486</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Taking the next step outward in space, some 13 megaparsecs away, in the increasing scale of
galactic cores lies the Super Galactic Center (with galaxy M-87). This powerful black hole
devours everything in sight. M-87 has the mass of 30 trillion Suns, though 90% of it remains
hidden to any observable form. A photograph taken in 1918 of M-87, revealed a luminous spike
emitted from the core of the galaxy. Dubbed the "jet" this emission foreshadowed
incomprehensible discoveries to follow. The ejected jet bore strong blue shift characteristics.
Later, a counter-jet was discovered. Galactic neighbor M-84 falls very precisely on this axis of
the counter-jet - a disconnected galaxy directly woven into to the vortex&#8217;s web. The X-Ray jets
reveal the last energetic hurrah of matter compressing into nonexistence as it prepares to enter the
void of the Super Galactic Center.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> These jets contain X-Ray "knots." The initial measured X-Ray
luminosity for the Virgo cluster was 10<sup>43</sup> ergs/sec compared to the solar reference standard of
10<sup>26</sup> ergs/sec for the Sun. Every second this complex object generates a factor of 10<sup>17</sup> times the
energy of our star! The Super Galactic Center once held the title of the only Super-Massive Black
Hole. With the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope, many other supermassive black holes
have come to light. However, the Super Galactic Center is the prevailing, dominant force in the
supermassive arena. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The largest known black holes, ZS, gravitationally organizes more than thirty galaxies, ours
included, at the cost of cannibalizing all of them. Contained in this congregation structure lie 3
trillion stars and over ten thousand globular clusters, all captive to the infinite gravity, time
dilation and violent energy eruptions of this central influence!</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This early Libran cosmic vacuum cleaner remains insatiably hungry. The axis of acceptance and
approval, classic to the sign of Libra, takes on infinitesimal proportions. Usually this manifests as
sequential monogamy, however, keeping several relationships in the air can occur in extreme
cases. The serial relationship syndrome squeezes the existing relationship partner into taking on
all that matters in the person's life. The partner feels the exceptional squeeze of needing to be all
things and at all times. The relationship is doomed. No one, no thing, probably not even one God
can deal with that much co-dependant compression. Ultimately, the relationship partner squirts
out of there past the breaking point, gasping for whatever flicker of personal energy might still
remain. And then another committed relationship begins.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As reported in Carlos Castaneda's <i>The Art of Dreaming</i>, one of Castaneda's initiations consisted
of encountering a <i>nagual</i>, or sorcerer, known as the Defier of Death. The Defier carried a
reputation as one of the oldest living sorcerers who would appear and make a deal with
Castaneda. The <i>nagual</i> needed Carlos&#8217; energy to continue on and would grant him something in
return. It had to be an agreed deal - nothing could be surmised or assumed by presence or
proximity. Castaneda persisted in just trying to "give" his energy to the sorcerer, but she (who
was just recently a &#8220;he&#8221;) would have nothing of it. Don Juan, the sorcerer under whom Castaneda
studied for years, warned Castaneda that this transaction could kill him and yet, was unavoidable.
As the deal went down, the sorcerer granted Castaneda the ability to dream and gain total intra-dimensional perception such that he could perceive the nature of energy. Castaneda slipped into
an altered state of consciousness that apparently lasted overnight. When Don Juan finally found
Castaneda, he had existed in the shifted consciousness for nine days. As one in love often reports,
&#8220;How time flies when you&#8217;re having ecstatic fun.&#8221; Regardless, an extreme, possibly cosmic
energy transaction resulted, mutually benefitting both parties, despite the potentially doubtful
appearances of the deal.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The opposite sort of dynamic all too often happens in what appears to be "normal" interpersonal
(any direct one-to-one connection regardless of context) relationships. The black hole personality
here possesses unbelievable powers of attraction. They can fish in even the most resistant
potential partner once they attach their potent gravity beam. The charisma, charm and appeal of
these people runs off the personality charts. They do more than woo you on the psychological
level. They capture you energetically. Then, they demand your energy. They usurp your essence
taking you down into their void. This condition lasts until the perception of the contributor
realizes the magnitude of exhaustive sacrifices unconsciously being rendered. The partner breaks
free with absolute and sheer volition. Others comment upon return of the participant that they
have been gone for a long time. To the one who fell into the void, it lasted forever... as long as
the blink of an unseeing eye. Regardless, this transaction does contain a strange symbiosis. Both
people need each other in a specific, unavoidable way. The relationship actually fulfills a
relationship destiny, leaving both lesser in energy, but hopefully wiser in perception.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Those contacting the Super-Galactic Center contain a super-massive hunger. They need and need
and need. They quest for the perfect relationship as if it is the Holy Grail... and to them it is. The
one and only syndrome reaches its apex here. Still, no one can live on the needle</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> point of that
precarious pyramid.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"> Nothing that exists can successfully fill that open space. Anything entering is
either destroyed, at worst, or at best, transmuted. This consumption continues until finally the
person figures out that no one or no thing can ever fill the emptiness felt inside. Typically, some
childhood trauma that negated one's self-worth can be found in the psychology. And sometimes
there is no definable family or origin scar. Should one scour the archives of past lives seeking the
source? No. It does not matter here what the origin is. The intellectual understanding offers
nothing to the essence of this situation. It must be healed, regardless. The magnitude of these
emotional cravings exceeds those wounds by exponential extremes. The scars will be healed,
though. It takes time. It takes unfailing energy from the ultimate inexhaustible resource - the
source of one&#8217;s soul.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Extreme cases of the Super-Galactic Center involve obsession with relationship. One of my
favorite jokes told in contemporary comedy comes from a comic indicating that he paid a lot of
attention to his former girlfriend, &#8220;Okay, so today they call it stalking,&#8221; he reports to the 
audience. Once one executes the interactive black hole dive, the attention placed upon the
relationship seems never-ending, saturated and overwhelming. These reactions will be felt by
both participants, more typically by the individual on the receiving end of the attention. It
remains critical to remember that such relational involvements, from the point of view of a
supermassive black hole, simply cannot be resisted. This has nothing to do with a lack of will.
Somehow the soul determines that this interaction will serve the evolution immediately required,
even if, and especially if, the relationship does not reach its expected emotional destination.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Relationship endings are particularly difficult for this galactic point. The pain seems to last
longer and the healing process rivals any classic love tragedy. This effect exists <i>only</i> because the
grieving partner placed total self-energy into the other person&#8217;s energy. A tear in the aura goes
with the emotional anguish of separation. This energetic rip debilitates the person for a while.
Appetite, energy and the ability to conduct daily life cease to exist. Other wounded parties exhibit
the rebound characteristics with great relish. Here, they immediately seek another relationship
guaranteed to fall infinitely short of the relationship just ended. This relationship slam dunk sets
the individual back even further. But it does make the clear point that adding energy to a void
that cannot adequately reciprocate, fails miserably. </span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Sexual intensity increases for these people. They promise the potential partner that they can meet
their every sexual need in ways they haven't even begun to fantasize. The truth be known, they
prepare to hook up their emotional/psychic vacuum cleaner to the partner and drink until the
partner's energy fails. At this point, sexual interest disappears. The psychological spin looks like
a person realizing that they can no longer support the intensity and creative fantasies that must
exist to sustain the fires of passion. It sounds as though one person cannot uphold their end of the
sexual bargain. The comment fired back in response sounds like , &#8220;Be careful what you wish for.
You got it and can&#8217;t deal with it. If you can&#8217;t play the game, don&#8217;t suit up.&#8221; While intending to
inspire the withdrawing partner to recommit to the relationship, guaranteed, the opposite effect
results from this pressure.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Some persons connected to this Black Hole transmute the energy from relationship orientation to
their career or even the purpose/destiny axis. This effort is more difficult to resolve because the
justifications for the obsession make rational sense. They can portray themselves on the threshold
of CEO-ness or sainthood. But they don't believe it. No salary can supplement this void. No
salvation rendered to the needy can attend to the singularity pressure to define godliness in a
profession. Married to a dysfunctional career, the divorce from work duties ultimately must
occur. Ideally, this occurs through choice. If not, firing, layoffs, early retirement or company
closures force the hand of healing.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Perhaps to this point, the picture of the Super-Galactic Center is grim. Really, it&#8217;s not grim at all.
Usually, one experiences the liabilities of the singularity, playing out standard psychologies and
basic human nature. One day, in timeless reality, it clicks. When the requirement of
consciousness of the Super Galactic Center shines multiple light bulbs in a person&#8217;s head, their
life changes on a dime.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When one shifts to the core meaning of the black hole and ceases the wrestling with the
psychological considerations, the spiritual issue appears for healing. There is a soul mate. The
first psychic I ever experienced in a</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">reading told me that your soul mate never incarnates at the
same time as you. Grinding your teeth over that one? Well, the point is that if one fully
covalently bonds their spirit to their own physical being, then a marriage to self, the ideal Sacred
Marriage occurs. This black hole does not define Sacred Marriage as the integration of female
and male (listed alphabetically) sides. It does not give two hoots about the left and right brain.
The essence of the black hole extends to that powerful point in space that ultimately consumes
everything we know. Everything is headed here, like it or not. It might just be better to jump on
the time/space curvature band wagon and beat the rush at the rapture. Simply, get inside yourself
and deal with the good that it is you.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Regardless of if this Libran point works itself out as relationship, work or destiny, it dominates
the life of one connected to it. Ultimately, the bottom line remains the same: the soul mate is
sought. The truths be known any external kindred spirit, a.k.a. the soul mate, cannot be
encountered until one completes the mating process with his/her own soul.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A self-dating protocol for healing works extremely well. In this time, preferably longer than
ninety days, the ZS contactee does recreational things alone - and consciously choosing to do so.
This offsets the tendency to establish rejection oriented isolation themes. So, she/he goes to
movies no one else wants to see. Enjoying dinners at unusual restaurants by oneself also fits the
bill. Walks in nature alone assist the process. Finally, intimate experiences with the self fill out
the agenda. This can consist of simply placing a hand over the heart and the other above the
sacral center in a soulful, self-full, love-bonding encounter.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Castaneda received countless lessons from Don Juan regarding the nature of energy compared to
the normal human perception of physicality. This black hole asks that you perceive your own
energy and fuse it with your physical-cellular structure. This is soul mating. The Super-Galactic
Center maintains the greatest implication of soul retrieval of any point in the Universe. It
demands that you get back in there and deal with yourself in an essential manner. It is essential
that you do so. It is also unavoidable. It will happen. The only question is when?</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">No more potent point of healing exists than that of the Super-Galactic Center. It discriminates
against no one and blesses those in contact with it by giving them a quick joyride into the
wonderful realm of their most potent essential nature. Anyone can call up the Super-Galactic
Center at any time. Those connected to it take on leadership roles relative to this quest. They
frequent this habitat themselves. They dare to take others on the healing joyride of complete self-discovery.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Time warps in all directions. Let's say someone submits to an intolerable physically abusive
relationship because they believe it is a karmic thing. More dysfunctional things have been said
in astrologers' offices, but not by much. Anyway, with this karmic thing keying the addiction,
consider that there must be a future life between these two people that will occur with a positive
relationship. Sure, it may be in a trillion years from now and on some planet you seen in a sci-fi
movie, but it'll happen. Imagine then, the qualities of emotional and spiritual understanding that
results when total acceptance and healing has occurred. Feel it? Good. Make it cellular. Conduct
self fusion again. Now take that awareness and overlay it in the lifetime just preceding the one
where these two really mucked it up in a past life. With that complete, the negative results of the
questionable lifetime cease to exist. That, from a pure physics standpoint, is correct. The healing
seals the relationship and it is now free to go forward without any more pain.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Remember that black holes warp both time and space. Karma, as a linear cause and effect
concept, falls as an obsolete theorem. Co-dependence and dysfunctional relationship behavior
intend to endure similar fates.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Any addictive behavior can be resolved with ZS by totally indulging the nature of one's spirit.
The soul retrieval process alleviates addictive leanings. First, one clears out the hurt and negative
social/emotional/nurturing memories bearing negative sensation. The soul, preferably with the
assistance of a facilitator, is sought out, retrieved, brought back and hooked up in the body to the
DNA structure. At this point, creating a positive, sentient, purely physical experience that can be
recalled at any given time greatly amplifies the retrieval. It is really that simple. And it&#8217;s also that
hard.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As a sharp example, comedian Dennis Miller (11/3/1953) owns a natal Mars to ZS. Miller deems
nothing sacred and attacks all attachments people make in life often asking where people lost
themselves along the way. Though his humor rubs many the wrong way, he bumps you up
against your own event horizon and suggests a look inside the orifice of what makes you tick. He
terrorizes dysfunctional relationship. He blasts those subject to relationship addiction and abuses.
He pulverizes those in the positions of power failing to demonstrate any ability to comprehend.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">
His ultimate message seems to be: &#8220;Hey, pal, figure it out.&#8221;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">As a more generational example, Mormon leader, Brigham Young, was part of a generation of
people with Uranus conjunct ZS. At this time in history, propagating the species made sense and
was a hard core reality. Life on the plains took its toll in the cost of many lives. Procreating
provided the assurance that the sect would continue. Plural marriage relationships and polygamy
held the answer and made sense to these people. This sect easily accepted the idea that as many
wives as you could support, you could have. Not only did Brigham Young charismatically and
gravitationally pull his followers together and westward, he maintained his share of marriage
partners being a good example of the &#8220;be fruitful&#8221; principle.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A relatively easy releasing exercise allows for the removal of those individuals seeming to hold a
magnetic grip on the life of another. This procedure also enables reclamation of one's own power
and prevents future negative bonding with other individuals possessing psychically cannibalistic
dispositions.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">First, imagine your own space... your own place. This place can be a meadow, atop a cloud, in a
sacred chamber... your choice. This location is unknown to others and remains impenetrable to
possible intruders. No one gets to enter this space without your consent.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Look about this space and fully view it. Note the colors, contents, smells and the feeling of the
place. Savor it.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now, allow one of the individuals with whom you have a relationship issue to enter. He or she
approaches you and stops a bit less than arms&#8217; length away. Take each others' hands and engage
eyes, left eye to left eye. Say firmly, "I freely release you and I ask you to freely release me."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This next part comes with qualification. The criterion intends to say either or both of these next
statements if they can be said with complete clarity and honesty. It fails to serve your emotional
nature if you push to achieve lovingness or forgiveness prior to your ability to do so. Great
emotional damage can be done by jumping to assuming these emotional states before expressions
of full grief, rage, betrayal and the like are complete. Perhaps it seems spiritual to quickly forgive
and let go, but if you are not there emotionally, the results may create excessively damaging
denial.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This being noted, they say to the former or pending partner, "I freely forgive you and I ask you to
freely forgive me." Then, "I freely love you and ask you to freely love me."</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">At this point drop hands and without any further contact, see the other person, of his/her own
volition turn and walk away. This person then completely disappears. They can walk out a door,
over a hill, dissolve, maybe even explode into a burst of purple and gold light, but they are gone.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Now review your space. Ensure that you stand alone. Check the energy for leaks. The space
needs to be seen as pristine.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Imagine a beautiful door, ornate if you will, but a fantastical door, not connected to any wall...
just a door... in the middle of your sanctuary. Approach the door knowing that when you open the
door the most fantastic thing that has happened to you in a long while will occur. Place your hand
on the door knob and open the door. On the other side, there you stand, facing yourself. Step
through the door, approach yourself, taking you other part by the hands. Engage your eyes, left
eye to left eye. Take a breath. Say to yourself, "I freely release you and ask you to freely release
me. I freely forgive you and ask you to freely forgive me. I freely love you and I ask you to freely
love me." This being said, draw yourself near and hug yourself. Embrace yourself until you
merge into oneness. Step back through the door, close it behind you and make it disappear.
Review your sacred space back to its original look. Take a breath and come back to conscious
attention. The release is complete.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">You may do this procedure each and every time a person you seek to release comes to mind. In
fact, if you have just started a new relationship, it is a great idea to release this person as well.
This effort clears a good deal of the <i>karmic</i> backwash allowing the relationship to advance
without baggage.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">You can perform this release for every past relationship, whether they be familial, professional or
personal. It remains important to conduct the last half of the release. This self-connecting
segment ensures that the void created by the absence of the other person's energy gets filled with
you. Subsequently, no other person will be called upon to fill the void and the cycle is broken.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">This releasing exercise, if done devoutly, will produce a notable change in the relationship
released in a relatively short period of time, typically days. Constant participation with this
visualization remains critical through the time of transition from a significant relationship.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">With the void of the supermassive Black Hole sealed with the spirits of the soul, the ZS
inhabitant now moves forward, ready for the next step. The next step looms as a big one. It is that
of teacher or healer. As teacher, the task before you stands as one of revealing other concurrent
realities and pointing out the absurdity of the bonding to the current mind set. As healer, one
literally and figuratively draws negative energy from another person. This healing method works
like a psychic siphon. A connection occurs, followed by intense and overwhelming drainage. At
the end of purging, the healer seeks to locate the essence of the healee's soul. The soul returns
and the healer uses positive energy to seal the soul in place. The healer then must purge his/her
own system. Sometimes this process is extremely intense, but it goes with the territory. Finally,
after the healer's purge completes, the healing settles into place. Disconnection and release must
now happen. Otherwise negative psychic linkage lingers, causing both individuals to negatively
pull upon one another, creating an emotional dysfunction from hell. This malady holds no real
place in the scenario and becomes very hard to resolve. It cannot be resolved with conversation
or a psychological approach.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">The problem maintains its core in energy and silence with energy
withdrawal constitutes the remedy.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">A remaining important point to the ZS healing model observes: Clear first, bond after. To be
socially perfect, one would not invite others for tea without cleaning the parlor. The same idea
applies to soul retrieval. All the emotional debris must get gone. Creating empty, hollow, free
inner space opens the door for receptivity. A soul retrieved before clearing occurs, will escape at
the first possible opportunity. This mechanism creates the sense that one can never heal the soul,
which is not at all true. Follow the doctrine. Clear out all refuse, physical and psychic. Savor the
hollow. Honor the space. Bring the good of spirit home.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Those individuals who have processed within the Super Galactic Center&#8217;s blessing, sealed their
souls and accepted the <i>karma</i> of their role in life, then embark on the real quest for soul mate. If,
of course, they choose to have a singular life mate. This mate just drops into life with remarkable
ease. The ZS ego knows that with the soul intact, he/she can relate with anyone of like spirit
without the demand that this person be the one and only. Here the axiom, "Like attracts like," sets
into place. The more like oneself the potential partner is, the more successful the relationship
becomes. Blessed with a clear <i>karmic</i> slate, a knowingness of <i>dharma</i>, the ZS resident glides
through life on an emotional high beam, attracting only those of high spirits. They now serve as a
model of healing for others solidifying the last rustle of the soul urge for the ultimate life.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">No matter what application one chooses, the Super Galactic Center prevails in one&#8217;s life. Perhaps
one would argue that this impinges upon free will. Actually, it does not. The Super Galactic
Center dryly comments that you must have known something of this agenda prior to incarnation.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Once integrated, those 
  directly involved with Super Galactic Center become directly involved as a central 
  force of healing in the lives of unimaginable numbers of people. Whether a casual 
  interaction by social standards, or a long-term committed program of healing, 
  the results are the same. Potent, powerful pushes toward clear self-allowing 
  Universal Reality results. Imagine what you would be if you were all that you 
  really are.</span></p>
