  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4">1. Quaoar in the first 
    house</font> means solid money and bold succesful enterprise. Go for the best 
    and hit at the center. The rise of capital while moving to the central position. 
    This is a wage rising position. Workers asking for a rise should boldly step 
    into the office of their boss and speak from it's center. Since the boss occupies 
    the main desk which shields him and has lured the stalker onto his own territory, 
    the stalked in assumes a surprise central position and speaks from his true 
    geometrical heart.</b></p>
  <p><b> 2. Investing capital overseas. Quaoar in the second house means export 
    import business. The stress is on export. The quick shipping of goods requires 
    no storage facilities. The sea has always been the natural route for a large 
    exportation. Dividing the enterprise into smaller venues is a well known defense 
    attack tactique. Big monopolists can hide splitting their systems = you don't 
    know which trees are really mine and get lost in the forest. What if they 
    are _all_ mine? DIVIDE ET IMPERA as attacking tactics or SPLIT AND CHOOSE 
    THE BEST for you. This is like a lion tearing a gnu apart and choosing the 
    best flesh first. This position means safe expense. The Vatican cartel.</b></p>
  <p><b> 3. Quaoar in the third house means extra gain. This meaning extends to 
    surprise gain or lucky strike like rewards for a work well done. Since there 
    does not seem to be an immediate connection between the reward and the work, 
    we are inclined to see this position as good fortune. But the third position 
    is not that simple. It requires foresight and help from centaur Asbolus. Shipping 
    in a hurry or a business trip will at best be dissuaded by wise introspection 
    or divination. This is not a time to hurry. We don't have all the parameters 
    at hand and are yet capable to deal with unexpected business. Disposing of 
    a troublemaker will not be easy. My advice would be to be very reasonable 
    and take no big risks. Even divination and Asbolus himself cannot predict 
    all the issues of tis position. Facets of this position include people who 
    did not decide if they do care or not for money at all the `nothing really 
    matters' attitude. Intruders can live without any money or work since they 
    surprise society with their lack of compatibilty. Who shall sow shal reap. 
    Even when he forgot. Thus benefit comes from past good deed. Duty does what 
    it should and does not calculate the result. This looks like special karma. 
    At the time when I was writing these lines, encouraged with the behavior of 
    finantial asteroid 2002 AW197 in the case of Alaska, I dared venture in the 
    middle ages. 1300 is the year. It seems that Quaoar had a long conjunction 
    with 2002 AW197 at that time. This very lines are the example of Quaoar in 
    the third house. One writes for the sake of writing an perhaps profits later 
    when least expected! People will gain at lottery, acquire real estate, get 
    (in)famous, and experience a rise in personal power, money and property. The 
    working man is promoted. Students should persist with their studies to the 
    victorious end. All in all, students prosper; when they discreate a phantom 
    menace. Merchants experience profit. Afflictions still lead to a harmonious 
    issue, but require common sense, social intelligence, an undertaking attitude 
    and plenty of space for improvisation on the spot. Enterprises still young 
    experience unexpected ups and downs. After a time and a transit, a well regulated 
    pattern takes us to safe waters.</b></p>
  <p><b> 4. Quaoar in the fourth house seems to cherish musical industry and show 
    business. In less prudish times, this type of business could be called prostitution. 
    Film stars are sexual symbols and supermodels are phallic symbols. This position 
    is enhanced by centauress Chariklo. This is the position of the problem solvers. 
    Even if solving the problem is to make one relax for a while. Rockefeller 
    who lived under stress and paranoia from his own close co workers, once escaped 
    and got mind cured by a farmer friend. Entertainment as anti stress and possibly 
    source of inspiration? Among the possible delineations, this position might 
    include the propagandistic activities of the black lodges. Since investment 
    is our topic, it seems that a highway is a best investition. Building is favored. 
    Prostituition allures the false mind. Psychobabble is not true learning. The 
    mind is hardly silenced and concentrated in this position. The lower cakra 
    and sexual instincts play a major role in the world of advertising. Show them 
    a good pair of legs and have the `right words' and they buy the product. It 
    is such a manner that advertising stirrs up temporary enthusiasm towards things 
    ephemeral. They all want must have it! Glamor propaganda and show business 
    can even stirr and send people to war. The stimulation is visual, sexual and 
    verbal. One is convinced he fights for his ideals. Glenn Miller and Marylin 
    Monroe enMesh a convincing marshing atmosphere for the typical male to die 
    for his ol'boys cigar Elvis and Southern Comfort, and the japs might as well 
    go to hell. While the japs might have demigods for kings and eternal life, 
    this cotton warrior fights for a drink in the bar. The business of the broker 
    is to attract/divert attention to easy stocks. This is bull-baiting at it's 
    best. Uncle$aming the nation. </b></p>
  <p><b>5. A mighty finantial concern is investing capital overseas with success. 
    The organization may have a semireligious connotation. A masonic lodge enters 
    business. The primary motives are not gain. Insurance companies. With us your 
    money is safe. Swiss banking. Foundations like money distributing institutions. 
    Large transport companies. Shipping dangerous material. Exporting wine. Helping 
    the nations in dire need. UNICEF? Taking care of the family. Various religious 
    organizations sending missionaries. Daniel Quinn would not agree on this but 
    Quaoar in the fifth house does not seem to be interessed in personal gain</b></p>
  <p><b>. 6. Quaoar in the sixth house is a sure omen of majestic business success 
    and honestly earned riches. Even in a horary or solar return chart, this position 
    is most promising!</b></p>
  <p><b> 7. This position never seems to accomplish anything. The whole affair 
    might stand on rotten legs. Outdated ideas, unfinished projects, too strong 
    opposition, the lack of support, goods, base materials. Time to start something 
    really new and strong.</b></p>
  <p><b>8. Taking a chance on a risky new enterprise. The total reform means investing 
    in new facilities. Food industry favored. Strong opposition and competition. 
    Disharmony within the enterprise. Good for fashion designers and stylists 
    who aim at shocking the public. Works fine with Chariklo. Good for fast food. 
    Excellent for `usa e getta' use and dispose off objects. Bad for merchandise 
    awaiting too long for shipping. Excellent for Murano glass. This position 
    seems to favor original ideas, possibly turned into mass product and shipped 
    immediately. One example could be the Pokemons. The feel is this is not an 
    easy position for Quaoar.</b></p>
  <p><b> 9. Legal issues. A very hard position. Partners will quarrel. Old karma 
    resurface. In extreme cases lawsuits require even carceration. Interference, 
    jealousy, mafia, physical injury, agressive negotiations. A third party very 
    likely interferes. Industrial espionage, criminal, mangled or old goods sold, 
    lawsuits follow. The market in it's triumphal madness. Stock exchange. Sanctions. 
    War games. Meat industry. Cat food. This position is enhanced with any Sun 
    Mars square. </b></p>
  <p><b>10. Quaoar in the tenth house has a surprising impact on the horoscope. 
    If this planetoid ever appeared as calm and transparent, it is in this position 
    that it shows it's transforming power. Almost like Pluto, it does not tollerate 
    old positions. It favors violent upheavals instead. Wherever `dislodging' 
    was mentioned, it is this side of Quaoar that acts. Invisible in time to an 
    unattentive observerer, the ever present change acts and with vehemence, too, 
    to the surprise of the monopolist. Something moved in the corner. Tentacles 
    grew in the dark lake. There was a stirring in the reeds. The guardian who 
    ignored it will see his tyrant unhorsed and his reign speeded into oblivion 
    now. The Wheel of Fortune is unfavorable to the tyrant. In political terms 
    this refers to revolutionary change. The Doge of Venice was humiliated by 
    Napoleon. Venetian churches were stripped of their Bons, Tintorettos, Tizians, 
    Tiepolos, Palmas and Strozzis. One loses his political independence and is 
    punished for tyrany. Often the change comes typically from within his enterprise. 
    Quaoar in the tenth house mercilessly announces losing power while being humiliated 
    by the confiscation of one's possessions. It is thus the herald of bancrupcy. 
    I might add that Venice did plunder for at least a couple of hundred of years. 
    This mediteranean transport monopolist loot includes two monumental columns 
    one can observe nowdays in the main square. They were too heavy for Napoleon 
    to take. But don't count on the apparently implicit message and get away with 
    it. Things xhange, will change and Napoleon can still bombard the collumns. 
    Those who gained will lose. It might not be visible now. Wait for some triggering 
    direction and transit and monopolism ends up in one day. This can mean great 
    stock exchange upheavals unrepairable by today's technology. Old rubber on 
    a stalled market does not stand a chance. Old rubber has not the elastic qualities 
    this penetrating planetoid attacks with triumph. This is Quaoar announcing 
    a new aeon. </b></p>
  <p><i><b>his number is eleven</b></i></p>
  <p><b>11. With Quaoar in the eleventh house, whether in a nativity or a horary 
    chart, one is well advized to save his stocks and resources. The eleventh 
    house is of course the one of the money earned by the enterprise. As a rule: 
    do nothing. When unsure, don't act. And when you act, act from slightly behind 
    the scene. Keep what you got, especially real estate. Form a trust, an interest 
    circle, a club; but trust only the oldest friends. Beginnings of big enterprises. 
    Imperial adventures. Ruling a land. The Queen and the country. We're losing 
    droids fast. Only old friends will do, and as a rule only those in which you 
    had and could have confidence at least for the last ten years. Olive oil industry 
    and resources are favored, woman clubs, a long established exchange with a 
    minister, friends few but tried and true. In fact a decrease in social mingling 
    seems favored. Discretion. This is the position of the stalker secretly moving 
    with refined detachment; instead of the lurking, thus obvious unpatient beginner.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 12. This last house paradoxally cherishes the former monopolists and 
    successful people in your business. One pilgrims to the tomb of Henry Ford. 
    One lights a candle for Forbes. No need for alarm but this does not seem to 
    be a richly enjoying house party. The conclusion of worldly ambitions. Some 
    quite unnecessary and unproductive regret. The position is obviousely past 
    one's competence, but as one leaves the world, little errors can be pardoned. 
    I note in sheer horror that the person is in favorable position of communication 
    with the other world. Dead persons will yield informations and skelletons 
    will speak. In my oppinion, this position is one of the person tryin to profit 
    from the experiences of deceased businessmen. Occult means can be applied, 
    and in fact I see them working!</b></p>

  <p><b><LOVE>Every newly discovered minor planet is expected to deliver. The

    one. Nothing like this happened in the past 200 years. Let us celebrate it

  <p><b><LOVE> LOVE&nbsp; </LOVE></b></p>
  <p><b><LOVE>About Quaoar and some extremely feminine horoscopes With Quaoar 
    in a good position and feminine aspects, we plunge into the Return of the 
    Matriachal Queendom. Perhaps we've been born out there first, out in the wilderness 
    and not on this Earth. If Quaoar is to be as feminine as Moon on the Ascendant 
    (Moon Earth conjunction). The 1963 - 1965 generation has a lovely Quaoar Spica 
    Virginis aspect. This conjunction can be hopelessly feminine when supported 
    by other aspects /1/. The 1969 case of Quaoar 1 sco is strikingly sexy. Quaoar 
    at first did not show this part of it's nature, but it might become the popular 
    face of this icy planetoid. Chariklo the centauress had this warming up function 
    in a class of objects called the centaurs, to which her partner Chiron pertains, 
    too. This type of women is a man killer and head hunter. They of course could 
    not care less of their victims, but they finds it charming! Ice melts from 
    time to time, even black ice, but the amazon core steers it's course accordng 
    to some natural (9) strategy. Sqeeze and drop. Back to the basic lessons of 
    animal kingdom, then. This is not Barbie or Disney. This is real life. I'll 
    have the immense pleasure to monitor a special case I know personally very 
    well, indeed. A case of (do I have to say) lovely twins that have an 11 sag 
    ascending sun. Hope this features in the following articles. Namely, Quaoar 
    transits that degree at this time. A case of exceptional beauty, a voluptuous 
    little doll, 1978 brand, caught my attention. She has an exact Venus (10 tau) 
    Quaoar (10 sco) opposition. I leave this note here for the forthcoming erotastrologer. 
    I'm adding an example for the sake of stirring some research. A separating 
    (3 degree) aspect of Mars (Spica) Quaoar 1965 represents an unapproachable 
    or hardly approachable beauty. At the risk of being aware of trying to squeeze 
    cosmetics from a mere icy rock, I suppose `all man in each man' and something 
    human even in God. In that way the prophets could approach God and in the 
    same way, probing like a bunch of Ewoks, we approach giant icy rocks. Keeping 
    the real delineations secret is another thing. The general public would not 
    know how to interpret them. The language in which they are written is too 
    private and perhaps `occult'. Even this short proposal fountains with expressions 
    out of the newspaper world. /1/ To propose some; Moon in Cancer trine Venus, 
    Chariklo conjunct Venus, Venus square Cassini Lilith and/or Neptune, Mars 
    square Saturn (vamp), Scorpio Sun with Sagittarius rising, Venus Spica Jupiter, 
    Cassini Lilith conjunct Uranus. Examples abound.&nbsp; 
    <!-- Oct 15th 2002  

-->
    Getting married right away. Problems to be expected and solved. Quaoar can 
    help the Astromancer in calculating marriage issues, when the rulers of the 
    ascendant and the descendant do not present themselves in an easy arithmetical 
    fashion.&nbsp; 
    <!-- Oct 13th 2002  -->
    Never heed what they say. Faith I have and put in you. Every day is something 
    new. And nothing else matters! Fealty, capable of long waiting, firstborn, 
    old fashioned love, never give up on that girl! Sex might suffer because of 
    religious and finantial drawbacks. Missionary posture.&nbsp; Tao knows neither 
    yin nor yang. Yin is naturally faithful since there is only one partner in 
    sight, Yang. Yinyanging brings about further difficult choices. Let Quaoar 
    be the lord protector of the first love. In time, a temptation is resisted. 
    Truemind is not false. It is true. The original chaos gives birth to the first 
    semblances. Man and woman enmesh. When afflicted, 2002 LM60 gives birth to 
    colonies of slippermen. The husband does not perform well his functions as 
    concerns being out and fighting. He does not deliver what is expected from 
    him in the world outside his family. Marriage is not favored. The mistress 
    will have several lovers. Fealty falsely sworn. The husband might take to 
    booze and die in loneliness. People with afflicted Quaoar might have an overprotective 
    bossy attitude, determined to protect what they have and are behind their 
    strongholds. Klingzor archetype, as opposed to Parzeval. Parzefalus is truemind 
    unintentionally provoking Klingzor's self-castration. The old interplay of 
    truemind (the Moon matrix) and false mind (Sun, ego, los voladeros). This 
    affliction is like the fixed square between Taurus and Leo, hierophant's lust.&nbsp;We 
    kill no indians. There is no devil. Quaoar is good.&nbsp; The transneptunes, 
    being disinteressed in man, exert a powerful long lasting impersonal influence 
    on the affairs of mice and men. The last planet(ary beings) `interested' in 
    (punishing) the fate of man seem(s) to be Saturn(ian beings, ONQIM). The Uranus 
    sphere is hardly attainable even to the few major adepts. The transneptune 
    sphere and mission (if any) is completely hidden even from semigods. Thus 
    some further annotations and keywords concerning little giant 2002 LM60 Quaoar 
    (H 1.6), a recent discovery. Fatality. VIS MAJOR. Temptation. The undercover 
    knowledge of being enslaved by the devil. First step to exorcism. Faithfulness 
    without a choice. Lovers divided by space (time). Fate. Physical life. The 
    mistery of evil. Los voladeros. Time as master over the destiny of mere humans 
    and initiates. Magister Templi. Evil temptation. Cancer. When afflicted 2002 
    LM60 Quaoar seems worse even than Varuna and yet more mysterious that Varuna. 
    Both will hide their secrets for a long time, while Ixion seems more `cooperative' 
    and/or prone to show off. As with Varuna, when one is having Qoaoar problems, 
    they are hidden. Man ignores the very existance of inorganic beings (devils, 
    los voladeros) and is thus enslaved. Not that being aware of their existance 
    would help him much. His mind wil object such absurd and dreadful propositions, 
    not being his mind at all. Therefore no one will believe in this part of the 
    delineation. Further on when this object becomes an object of war, the mind 
    will be commanded to discard such a proposal (we are the good guys). We kill 
    no indians. There is no devil. Quaoar is good. This also explains the Tarot 
    card having to do with enslave ment. The enslavement is on the mental plane, 
    in that the inorganic installsa mind for the man-slave. We have been implanted 
    such default minds and go around using them and thinking we do the thinking. 
    Zen calls them `little minds', Osho suggests getting rid of them. But it is 
    not so simple to stop thinking even for a split second. People try with orgasm, 
    perhaps drugs, holidays, excitement, but they `just can't shake the Beast'. 
    Attempts at meditation and genuine majik training, as well as aikido gradually 
    remove the false mind or ego. Quaoar might be the very home of los voladeros, 
    however fantastical this proposal even for the initiates. There is a good 
    side to everything and simple minds will rejoice in shamanistic revivals if 
    the proposed name Quaoar will be accepted. I attempted the arduous task of 
    describing the non-human side of this distant icy rock. Why would it have 
    anything to do with humans at all? Just because we name it? Or it suits our 
    post new age business, perhaps soothing everything but perfect mothers or 
    sell pseudoshamanism to us white trash? I'd believe a Navajo, in fact I'm 
    working on it. Navajo astrology would perhaps have Quaoar near the Rabbits 
    Paws constellation. This is highly experimental, though; we are a few days 
    from the discovery and even the orbiral parameters are liable to change. The 
    object is not named yet. But this time is the best to set some first naive 
    delineation.&nbsp;</LOVE></b></p>

    seeks HimSelf does not live in the world any more. Silent task performer. 
    The rewards for a work well done is a new task. Mapping the planet. Riding

    meeting the devil. The clash of opposite forces. A waoman badly in need of 
    a man. Crossing this line brings more and more responsability, a hard working 
    life, self denieal, blood, sweat and tears. Good perhaps only to the spiritual

  2002 LM60 MAJIK Majikal influence of Quaoar 2002 - 2005 excluding sigils and 
  talismans for travel and good luck on the sea. Quaoar influences majikally in 
  threefold ways during the next three years. This is for general reference and 
  cannot be used for talisman and sigil production in this form and as presented. 
  FIRST MAJIKAL INFLUENCE - Traveling Astromancer Quaoar protects the traveler. 
  As Coelho's Alchemist, the traveler is likely to return and find his prize besides 
  his old hearth. Gales and hurricanes are warded off using a certain talisman 
  and sigil. Long travel initiated by the current position is likely to meet unwanted 
  drawbacks. A `member of the crew' can oppose the project. Like Crowley in Khaled 
  Khan or Hesse in Journey to the East, a bad star appears and it's demons. PRAESAEPE. 
  One talks the demons away. The company `of the Ring' will have quarrels, all 
  ends well. rescue missions are favored by this first influence. SECOND MAJIKAL 
  INFLUENCE - Astronomicon Incantations Ethical majikians will be trained in evocation. 
  Evocation is also a communication with a star-spirit, or a planetary god. ASTRONOMY 
  DOMINE as Pink Floyd would. The astromancer induces a trance and receives and 
  discusses with this second influence. Powerful majik words will dominate every 
  spirit as this initation is received by a highly ethical and balanced adept. 
  THIRD MAJIKAL INFLUENCE - Astralogy Astrology is an astral science. In this 
  initiation, the astromamcer learns his way about in the astral kingdom. The 
  incipient student practices lucid dreaming and O5 basics. In this phase, meeting 
  hostile entities assumes dramatical dimensions. FURTHER INFLUENCES - Kabala 
  and Finance - 2004 The two subsequent initiations will be kabala or the use 
  of word and color. Trade and monetary matters, the make of coins, is the next 
  initiation. Like the Euro, a new global currency may well be imminent. First 
  class finantial training, events and gain. One currency to bind 'em all. Finantial 
  domination and the science of creating a large profit. Monopoly. The incipient 
  majikian learns finantioal O5 first. See also 2002 AW197 finantiasteroid below

  Psi. A target with an arrow through the center. A drum on a decorated standard.

  screen baby. Computer random art. HEALTH Isolated, wrongly accused, falling

  <p><a href=mailto:iau28@yahoo.co.uk><img src=ybar.gif border=0></a></p>
  <p><b> 1. Quaoar in the first house can be used for kundalini majik, _if_ the 
    practicant knows what he does. On the whole if one can wait for a better time, 
    he is advised to skip the operation. Travel spells are perhaps favored and 
    majikal parties arranged.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 2. The Great Work. The 4 women stalkers supporting their Nagual. The 
    untruncated pyramid. He who climbs loses the world below. The progressing 
    airplane seems small. Distant goals seem so vague. In the case of the pyramid, 
    diminishing is progressing. Nothing is at the top. Nothing has a stong basis. 
    Quaoar was labeled `Magister Templi' in one annotation. However, it may rule 
    Binah. Let this degree remain secret for the time being and the purpose of 
    this article. The second house is PORTA INFERNA and in hell even Carlos Castaneda 
    works. Good for material gains connected with one's mission. Treasure charts 
    are futurity blueprints. Measure seven times, then cut. A perfect plan. All 
    goes according to masterplan. 3Jane. Partners split and form their own enterprizes. 
    Go your own way, then. Get rid of old majik tools and procedures, make space 
    for new.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 3. Do not rush. At this horary time await. In a hour or two the constellations 
    will warrant a prosperous issue. In the meantime have fun or take a trip. 
    Do not forget to avoid the evil star of Alpha Serpentis, too. /1/ If you must 
    use Quaoar with this position, do avoid 22 sco in the same house or prominent 
    /2/</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 4. A good position to help a friend victimized by drugs. Also for those 
    who have nightmares. Sometimes they are the blessed ones but in this case 
    nightmares can be true astral assaults. In war this position is one of vigil. 
    Night attacks expected. Towers are taken. Weaklings and double tongues are 
    dislodged. One does not easily use his majikal weapons. A new lodge and order 
    is proclaimed at this time. Dislodging. Sol in Gemini. Sol in Taurus.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 5. This position is perhaps the most favored of all. The majikian abandons 
    any interest in mundane matters. This is the true and lofty Astromancer. Excellent 
    time for astrology matters. Ascent in rank and title. One is welcome by gods. 
    Entering the perfect world. Karma is discreated. The witness technique. Om 
    saksi aham. Nemo. Disinteressed but successful. What a sublime opportunity!</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 6. Toil, fight, responsability, too much opposing forces, too eager to 
    do it right, too much fire. Even if all is well planned and orderly, the excessive 
    amount of zeal leads to dissapointment (like in extreme militant nationalism) 
    and the end is oblivion. Very evil for love majik. Not very good for an attack. 
    Pause. </b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>7. Peace. Natural flow. No need for celibacy. The lower three cakras at 
    work (as in Three of Cups). Perhaps having no wish at all or diminishing one's 
    ambitions and actions. Rest. Giving in.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 8. `We love you, CatMother!'. This is Molly's (Neuromancer) position. 
    All is fair in love and war. A divine fiery woman brings about unexpected 
    events. The matter at hand can be divined, though.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 9. And there were two. Twin stalkers. Twin dreamers. Twin dragons. Lodges 
    clashing after walking together for some time. Physical fight (Molly breaks 
    her leg). The MatriX has you! Grin and be out of it fast. 3Jane and Molly 
    in apparent fight. Jacob at Peniel.</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b> 10. Let the sun shine. Aspiration to the great boss. But the Beast can 
    bite! Be sure of your rank. Towards savikalpa samadhi, but one has still a 
    gross ego on his back. Los Voladeros. There and back, as Tolkien would. Retreat 
    if attacked. Anahata. False Mind. </b></p>

  The busy man at the airport perhaps closed his eyes for a second. You don't 
  know it, but he's just set up the vibration for his interview. Yes he created 
  an event ahead. Perhaps timed it, if he's a `snowcrashing' O5 master. What does 
  this mean? That people can actually create events out of the blue? Which people? 
  Is that legal? In O5 we trust. O5 is a natural active prayer. We just help God 
  tidying up a bit. Suggest a butterfly there, a blue sky here. Everybody imagines 
  mental pictures, sometimes full of emotion. Deliberate imagination upon a clear 
  silver screen begins as fiction factory and ends up materialized, one lives 
  his dream. Life has been meant to. While your kind religious upbringing prepares 
  the soul for self remembering, O5 is just a tool, the hand of man, perhaps touching 
  the Hand of God. It's a nice tool coming from Tibet. Welcome to it! If you are 
  reading this, you are liable to know much about astrology. What about the new

  Yes, our knowledge of the solar system improved drastically in the past decan. 
  The most important discoveries in the past 200 years have been made a couple 
  of years ago. I Ching is nothing new, of course. Perhaps the approach may change.

  of the majikal infinite being he was born into this world as the voladero feeds 
  upon man's energy and emotional emanation (thus monks train not to have emotions, 
  or observe them in `witness' fashion) /1/ futurity = a possible future, one

  a possible adventure) ming = mind |:| like a shining clear device true mind

  all things are fair in love and war &amp; delineation proposal&nbsp;</b> 
  <p><b><LOVE>Every newly discovered minor planet is expected to deliver. The 
    standard request is the hand of Helen of Troy and a purse full of gold. What 
    else God is for? Useless frozen rotating potatoes in outer space are out of 
    question. Jupiter has been trained to bring good luck (no thunderbolts, please; 
    fireworks) and settled down as resident casino dealer. Venus is always welcome. 
    Nothing seems to undermine humanity's childish chase for `love and money' 
    untill old age makes us chase pills. But even in old age one seeks love. We 
    are told and trained to. Who told us so and why we are useless instead of 
    majikal beings is too far fetched for this rather clumsy and occasionally 
    amusing analysis. We have a new minor planet up there. It is really a big 
    one. Nothing like this happened in the past 200 years. Let us celebrate it 
    and fill it's first delineations with our reflexes, fears, expectances, observances, 
    ideals; and also perhaps _hear_ from Quaoar itself what it has to say in it's 
    noble silence. Klaudio Zic, Oct 16th 2002 MONEY The profit is 300 %. Creative 
    transactions + courageuos !nitiative. Quaoar ascending brings attention and 
    money, support and good omens. LOVE&nbsp; About Quaoar and some extremely 
    feminine horoscopes With Quaoar in a good position and feminine aspects, we 
    plunge into the Return of the Matriachal Queendom. Perhaps we've been born 
    out there first, out in the wilderness and not on this Earth. If Quaoar is 
    to be as feminine as Moon on the Ascendant (Moon Earth conjunction). The 1963 
    - 1965 generation has a lovely Quaoar Spica Virginis aspect. This conjunction 
    can be hopelessly feminine when supported by other aspects /1/. The 1969 case 
    of Quaoar 1 sco is strikingly sexy. Quaoar at first did not show this part 
    of it's nature, but it might become the popular face of this icy planetoid. 
    Chariklo the centauress had this warming up function in a class of objects 
    called the centaurs, to which her partner Chiron pertains, too. This type 
    of women is a man killer and head hunter. They of course could not care less 
    of their victims, but they finds it charming! Ice melts from time to time, 
    even black ice, but the .mazon core steers it's course accordng to some natural 
    (9) strategy. Sqeeze and drop. Back to the basic lessons of animal kingdom, 
    then. This is not Barbie or Disney. This is real life. I'll have the immense 
    pleasure to monitor a special case I know personally very well, indeed. A 
    case of (do I have to say) lovely twins that have an 11 sag ascending sun. 
    Hope this features in the following articles. Namely, Quaoar transits that 
    degree at this time. A case of exceptional beauty, a voluptuous little doll, 
    1978 brand, caught my attention. She has an exact Venus (10 tau) Quaoar (10 
    sco) opposition. I leave this note here for the forthcoming erotastrologer. 
    I'm adding an example for the sake of stirring some research. A separating 
    (3 degree) aspect of Mars (Spica) Quaoar 1965 represents an unapproachable 
    or hardly approachable beauty. At the risk of being aware of trying to squeeze 
    cosmetics from a mere icy rock, I suppose `all man in each man' and something 
    human even in God. In that way the prophets could approach God and in the 
    same way, probing like a bunch of Ewoks, we approach giant icy rocks. Keeping 
    the real delineations secret is another thing. The general public would not 
    know how to interpret them. The language in which they are written is too 
    private and perhaps `occult'. Even this short proposal fountains with expressions 
    out of the newspaper world. /1/ To propose some; Moon in Cancer trine Venus, 
    Chariklo conjunct Venus, Venus square Cassini Lilith and/or Neptune, Mars 
    square Saturn (vamp), Scorpio Sun with Sagittarius rising, Venus Spica Jupiter, 
    Cassini Lilith conjunct Uranus. Examples abound.&nbsp; Getting married right 
    away. Problems to be expected and solved. Quaoar can help the Astromancer 
    in calculating marriage issues, when the rulers of the ascendant and the descendant 
    do not present themselves in an easy arithmetical fashion.&nbsp; 
    <!-- Oct 13th 2002  -->
    Never heed what they say. Faith I have and put in you. Every day is something 
    new. And nothing else matters! Fealty, capable of long waiting, firstborn, 
    old fashioned love, never give up on that girl! Sex might suffer because of 
    religious and finantial drawbacks. Missionary posture.&nbsp; </LOVE></b></p>
  <p><b><LOVE>Tao knows neither yin nor yang. Yin is naturally faithful since 
    there is only one partner in sight, Yang. Yinyanging brings about further 
    difficult choices. Let Quaoar be the lord protector of the first love. In 
    time, a temptation is resisted. Truemind is not false. It is true. The original 
    chaos gives birth to the first semblances. Man and woman enmesh. When afflicted, 
    2002 LM60 gives birth to colonies of slippermen. The husband does not perform 
    well his functions as concerns being out and fighting. He does not deliver 
    what is expected from him in the world outside his family. Marriage is not 
    favored. The mistress will have several lovers. Fealty falsely sworn. The 
    husband might take to booze and die in loneliness. People with afflicted Quaoar 
    might have an overprotective bossy attitude, determined to protect what they 
    have and are behind their strongholds. Klingzor archetype, as opposed to Parzeval. 
    Parzefalus is truemind unintentionally provoking Klingzor's self-castration. 
    The old interplay of truemind (the Moon matrix) and false mind (Sun, ego, 
    los voladeros). This affliction is like the fixed square between Taurus and 
    Leo, hierophant's lust.&nbsp;We kill no indians. There is no devil. Quaoar 
    is good. The transneptunes, being disinteressed in man, exert a powerful long 
    lasting impersonal influence on the affairs of mice and men. The last planet(ary 
    beings) `interested' in (punishing) the fate of man seem(s) to be Saturn(ian 
    beings, ONQIM A'anquim Anakin). The Uranus sphere is hardly attainable even 
    to the few major adepts. The transneptune sphere and mission (if any) is completely 
    hidden even from semigods. Thus some further annotations and keywords concerning 
    little giant 2002 LM60 Quaoar (H 1.6), a recent discovery. Fatality. VIS MAJOR. 
    Temptation. The undercover knowledge of being enslaved by the devil. First 
    step to exorcism. Faithfulness without a choice. Lovers divided by space (time). 
    Fate. Physical life. The mistery of evil. Los voladeros. Time as master over 
    the destiny of mere humans and initiates. Magister Templi. Evil temptation. 
    Cancer. When afflicted 2002 LM60 Quaoar seems worse even than Varuna and yet 
    more mysterious that Varuna. Both will hide their secrets for a long time, 
    while Ixion seems more `cooperative' and/or prone to show off. As with Varuna, 
    when one is having Qoaoar problems, they are hidden. Man ignores the very 
    existance of inorganic beings (devils, los voladeros) and is thus enslaved. 
    Not that being aware of their existance would help him much. His mind wil 
    object such absurd and dreadful propositions, not being his mind at all. Therefore 
    no one will believe in this part of the delineation. Further on when this 
    object becomes an object of war, the mind will be commanded to discard such 
    a proposal (we are the good guys). We kill no indians. There is no devil. 
    Quaoar is good. This also explains the Tarot card having to do with enslave 
    ment. The enslavement is on the mental plane, in that the inorganic installsa 
    mind for the man-slave. We have been implanted such default minds and go around 
    using them and thinking we do the thinking. Zen calls them `little minds', 
    Osho suggests getting rid of them. But it is not so simple to stop thinking 
    even for a split second. People try with orgasm, perhaps drugs, holidays, 
    excitement, but they `just can't shake the Beast'. Attempts at meditation 
    and genuine majik training, as well as aikido gradually remove the false mind 
    or ego. Quaoar might be the very home of los voladeros, however fantastical 
    this proposal even for the initiates. There is a good side to everything and 
    simple minds will rejoice in shamanistic revivals if the proposed name Quaoar 
    will be accepted. I attempted the arduous task of describing the non-human 
    side of this distant icy rock. Why would it have anything to do with humans 
    at all? Just because we name it? Or it suits our post new age business, perhaps 
    soothing everything but perfect mothers or sell pseudoshamanism to us white 
    trash? I'd believe a Navajo, in fact I'm working on it. Navajo astrology would 
    perhaps have Quaoar near the Rabbits Paws constellation. This is highly experimental, 
    though; we are a few days from the discovery and even the orbiral parameters 
    are liable to change. The object is not named yet. But this time is the best 
    to set some first naive delineation.&nbsp;</LOVE></b></p>
  <p><b>2002 LM60 `Quaoar' - In Houses - http://neodruid.tk / quaoar (C) 2002 
    Klaudio Zic, All Rights Reserved. </b></p>
  <p><b>A Guide in 2002 LM60 Quaoar transneptune in horary &amp; fun astrology. 
    1. Quaoar in the first house took the hard way of responsability for one's 
    own karma. People rarely assume complete responsability for their thoughts, 
    emotions and deeds and therefore the world is there to play with, hate and 
    put the blame upon. Otherwise there is none. One that seeks HimSelf does not 
    live in the world any more. Silent task performer. The rewards for a work 
    well done is a new task. Mapping the planet. Riding a mare at night in the 
    desert. The karmamechanic. The not-doer. Passively meeting the devil. The 
    clash of opposite forces. A waoman badly in need of a man. Crossing this line 
    brings more and more responsability, a hard working life, self denieal, blood, 
    sweat and tears. Good perhaps only to the spiritual `person', bad for earthly 
    pursuit. Attainment of territory best used for meditation. Unused ground. 
    2. A mysterious masked man moves at night across in the city of bridges. The 
    sky is cloudy. A powerful position. The stalker. Bad for marriage and fealty. 
    Completely new situation. The end and completion of a cycle. PORTA INFERNA. 
    The wand of power. The exorcist. The necromancer. Neuromancer. Astromancer. 
    Music. Rainbow colored night. Not partecipating in the carneval as yet. The 
    dreamer in ensueno. The absurdity of reincarnation. The man that is you. Going 
    about one's own secret paths. Independent. 3. The beloved. The womb of the 
    beloved. Breadwinner. Temporarely separated. Sexual life `suffers' rather 
    short restraints. The beautiful. Slight jealousy. The provider. A friendly 
    position. 4. Perhaps the worst position, in that it symbolizes finity. The 
    end. Birth and death interlaced, but the accent is on the end. Sometimes a 
    situation having no development and the coming of demons ever after. Every 
    beginning is hard, better not start anything with this position in your horary 
    or event horoscope. 5. A gossiping fellow back in jail soon. A loving relationship 
    causes truouble due to a gossiping young man. He receives money but is thrown 
    to jail. Idle and evil tongues provoke quarrel. This is like Mars in transit 
    squaring the ascendant of a Davison Relationship chart. The house of lust 
    besieged. 6. Working afterhours. Partying after a work undone. One orgasm 
    only between you two? Too satisfied to do further hard work? 7. With one's 
    own ego facing him, he makes progress and stirrs sympathy. A work well done. 
    Competence in the matter at hand. Phalus as punisher. Supermodels as phallic 
    symbol (Evangelista). 8. The womb. Woman demasked. Approachable. Some mental 
    confusion. 9. The womb in the centre of an 8. The ideally shaped woman. To 
    watch. Bathing naked for hidden observers. A host of illusions. 10. The woman 
    hand and her idle lover. Sexual favors. The kidnapped lover. Something is 
    yours that was not some time ago. Whose is it? 11. The womb. Two gentlemen 
    cross their swords on a bridge. Friendly contest, rather than fight to death. 
    Fighting for the resources. 12. The magical touch. Incantation. Seduced by 
    the spirit. Casanova. The medium. Masonry. Matriarchate. The ancestress. SVMMVM 
    BONVM. You are welcome to visit the Quaoar working laboratory and report.

  2002 LM60 MAJIK Majikal influence of Quaoar 2002 - 2005 excluding sigils and 
  talismans for travel and good luck on the sea. Quaoar influences majikally in 
  threefold ways during the next three years. This is for general reference and 
  cannot be used for talisman and sigil production in this form and as presented. 
  FIRST MAJIKAL INFLUENCE - Traveling Astromancer Quaoar protects the traveler. 
  As Coelho's Alchemist, the traveler is likely to return and find his prize besides 
  his old hearth. Gales and hurricanes are warded off using a certain talisman 
  and sigil. Long travel initiated by the current position is likely to meet unwanted 
  drawbacks. A `member of the crew' can oppose the project. Like Crowley in Khaled 
  Khan or Hesse in Journey to the East, a bad star appears and it's demons. PRAESAEPE. 
  One talks the demons away. The company `of the Ring' will have quarrels, all 
  ends well. rescue missions are favored by this first influence. SECOND MAJIKAL 
  INFLUENCE - Astronomicon Incantations Ethical majikians will be trained in evocation. 
  Evocation is also a communication with a star-spirit, or a planetary god. ASTRONOMY 
  DOMINE as Pink Floyd would. The astromancer induces a trance and receives and 
  discusses with this second influence. Powerful majik words will dominate every 
  spirit as this initation is received by a highly ethical and balanced adept. 
  THIRD MAJIKAL INFLUENCE - Astralogy Astrology is an astral science. In this 
  initiation, the astromamcer learns his way about in the astral kingdom. The 
  incipient student practices lucid dreaming and O5 basics. In this phase, meeting 
  hostile entities assumes dramatical dimensions. FURTHER INFLUENCES - Kabala 
  and Finance - 2004 The two subsequent initiations will be kabala or the use 
  of word and color. Trade and monetary matters, the make of coins, is the next 
  initiation. Like the Euro, a new global currency may well be imminent. First 
  class finantial training, events and gain. One currency to bind 'em all. Finantial 
  domination and the science of creating a large profit. Monopoly. The incipient 
  majikian learns finantioal O5 first. See also 2002 AW197 finantiasteroid below 
  or from webpage http://neodruid.tk / 2003/tno&nbsp;</MAJIK>SYMBOLS Pierced heart? 
  Psi. A target with an arrow through the center. A drum on a decorated standard. 
  A square with the middle marked. A waterbird in the form of the greek letter 
  `psi' shielding it's fledglings. 0. Humpty Dumpty. ARTS Visual naive arts. The 
  screen baby. Computer random art. HEALTH Isolated, wrongly accused, falling 
  hazard, sexual denial BUSINESS A big corporation triangulating the competition.
