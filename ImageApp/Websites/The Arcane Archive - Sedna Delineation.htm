    Hypoteticals such as the Avestans, Rathke Planets (see

    stock exchange, much as 2002 AW197 is favorable to real estate.

 The recent large astronomical discoveries are being delineated in

 and that legendary Quaoar, we have 2004 DW and Sedna. Enjoy this

 = Sedna = Astrological Delineation Update = http://puck.dhs.org

 It was the summer of '69. http://puck.dhs.org/sedna/summer69.gif

 Periodical summer conjunctions of our 2nd & 3rd moons (Cruithne &
 2002 AA29) involve Sedna and this is a superb omen as it brings
 relief to the omniverse. The nearest and the most distant blend
 in cOMmunion! The most happy nativities are those enjoying close
 conjunctions of 2002 AA29 and Sedna, such as in summer 1969. /*/

 This effect is particullary felt in the sixties! The closest and
 the most unimaginably distant and undiscovered blend in the sixties.
 Let us not forget the astral vedic and Rathke Planets, as well as a 
 host of hypoteticals from Cassini Lilith to Nibiru. The sixties
 downloaded this influences and we're just unzipping the files.
  
  Centaur Thereus joins the configuration in the early seventies.
  Centaur Pholus underlines the conjunctions around 1984. Chiron
  passes by, towering. (This is the product of a brief scan; other
  objects of interest are surely involved!).

    Since Sedna is fairly removed from most interplanetary disputes,
    it must be consulted as a fair judge over the petty gravitational
    matters closer to us. Astrologers either consult the centaurs,
    which are perturbed by various planets, or the aloof world of
    the transneptunians. But how can 2004 DW judge? Is Quaoar fair?
    Nessus is too disturbed to do any judgement, and Asbolus, albeit
    magus, has not as yet seen it all. The centaurs lack perspective
    as they're thrown here and there by influences and planetary
    gravitation. The centaurs are our close dark archangels, but
    they are unable to encompass and judge creation. Only Sedna
    is capable of impartial empathy towards the centaurs and 
    transneptunian cubewano, plutino (and SDO) objects.
 
 Get rich with horary $edna in the second house and savour the deep
 sea taste of Sednastrology while Sedna is still in Cetus constellation!

 /Adm/ Admetos is a hypotetical and as such lacks perspective.
       Sedna is a real object in Cetus, while hypotheticals
       seldom claim latitude, declination or constellation.
       |
       This leaves Admetos = Sedna as an interesting (or mere?)
       speculation. The second house effect is, nevertheless, 
       remarkable. Perhaps the two (?) work together?


 As promised, a little majikal initiation + SEDNA IN MAJIK +
 
 = Sedna in Majik = Featuring Dolphin Talismans by puck.dhs.org

 Not only the centaurs like Asbolus or 1992 TA ("Pylenor") have
 their majikal attributes. Sedna is aloof but filters majik as
 well by the very virtue of it's placement against us. Sedna is
 largely unconcerned with the inner turnmoil of the known solar
 system. Her gifts are thus disinteressed with no strings attached.

 This article precedes Sedna in the 12 astological houses much is the
 same fashion evocational majik is the well of astrological initiation.

    We don't suppose the house Franz Bardon has his own Sedna in,
    as we introduce it here for the sake of record. Sedna is overaspected
    in the magus incarnation horoscope but it is most remarkably the
    Saturn Mars midpoint as it seems responsable for the magician's
    captivity. Namely the nazi and a black lodge succeeded in torturing
    the magus. This is a complex subject and horoscope I must leave
    to more expert times. http://puck.dhs.org/sedna frabato

    Frabato's supposed troubles with the undines and watery element
    had a happy ending after dire danger. The depths are there to teach.
 
    It seems yet another type of masonry enjoys plumpy water sprites
    (more plumpy than sprites) here. Our obscure masonic hero Giacomo
    Casanova midpoints Sedna within his winning Mars Jupiter in 5th
    with womboid Cruithne brushing by. Sedna is long large and eternal
    erection and a peculiar disinterest in all the things one posessed.

    I love all, desire all, and after having it I don't crave for it
    any longer. I have left that girl by the river, while it's still
    in your mind. Castazeniac vibes, indeed. Casanova reminds us that
    Sedna is not Admetos is not Nemesis. 

    http://puck.dhs.org /reports /reports1 Casanova features Venus
    Devil Rose, HPMHC descending, Pholus Pluto, Sun Amor (darkplanet),
    bedsides Cruithne Sedna Mars Jupiter cluster. Admetos and Nemesis
    (darkplanet) seem involved with the magician's Moon.


 Aleister Crowley's Sedna initiates him into love majik. This issues 
 93 Agape - Thelema = the famous formula of Love under Will. Bardon
 adds "strong will" for the occasion, but this can be misleading. 
 Will is best conveyed by Carlos Castaneda, in my oppinion. 

 Changing hostility into friendship has been Crowley's forte, but 
 in cases like Mussolini, he also failed to obtain _too_much_
 friendship and sanctuary. perhaps this is a Sedna lesson: don't
 ask too much, or (for my O5 Masters:) "What does God (the Eagle) 
 owe to me that he must jump like a dog at my every whim?". Modesty.

 Perhaps Sedna helps the aloof and disposes of the wordly man. One
 can drink lemonade before and perhaps after the Holy Guardian Angel
 appears. It is of course not any of my business to spill lemonade.

 Sedna progresses very slowly in the magician's life. Year 1904.
 (See http://puck.dhs.org/2004DW). Sedna brings the magician to his 
 purpO5e. PurpO5e is also the theme of Matrix-the-movie. Akasha is
 loaded with PurpO5e. Rituals are carried on in the physical, astral
 and mental domain. The secrets of the water element are hidden in
 Sedna's progress. The spirits of the water elements led by Sedna's 
 progress in Cetus and the appropriate degree = head (spirit star or
 ascended master = friendly inorganic being = immortal) are at the
 service of the moral magus. The most beautiful undines are actually
 a threat for the magus as many married one to regret it when they
 were unable to remain faithful. Undines punish unfaithfulness with
 death, justified by the very marriage contract. Sedna is an undine
 for all practical purposes. In the seventh house it plays like a 
 dolphin with the magician's heart fountaining with love. 
 
 Sedna's dolphins entwined are quite the opposite to the triurne 
 Lamia of 2004 DW. Aloof Sedna has much love, but 2004 DW is a
 dangerous siren. Luckily for the thick skinned magus, 2004 DW
 will bite only to die from the poisonous magician's blood.

    The innocent magus is not supposed to hide an undine. He should
    marry her. Human heart knows vary few faiths and faithfulness
    can become a problem. The undine won't tollerate breaching and
    will demand the death of the magus, who will degrade into an
    astral underwater servant in Sedna worlds unimaginable to the
    neophyte. Sedna is thus the punishing deity in service of the
    undine bride. various stories of sirens are in fact all true.
 
 Sedna dips into the waters of our local omniverse like a siren
 launching a deep cry into her waters. Science and vedic lore
 agree about the composition of the minor planets in that they
 are composed of ice (water) and alcol. 

 Sedna currently initiates (via the appropriate degree spirit star
 head and ritual) into loveamulets. The amulets must be charged by
 a trained and moral magus. ( Meaning 30 to 50 years of secret and
 very hard training. )

>> The article contains Sedna and 2004 DW delineations, as well 
> as their meanings in the 12 horizon based astrological houses 

 Since both Sedna and 2004 DW contain a watery flavor, they are
 coupled in this analysis. Morever the Sedna communication comes
 in synch with 2004 DW discovery, even if it's own discovery is
 marked Nov 11th 2003. The Minor Planet Center still classifies
 Sedna as centaur object and we will probably see new classes of 
 objects popping out soon as we already did lately.

 The zodiac loses 4 constellations, assuming Pluto is _not_ a planet.
 In that case Eridanus (NEAT comet http://puck.dhs.org/comet, river 
 Po in Italy), Bootes (pastoral religions), Coma Berenices (Tiepolo's 
 Veronica's Hair at San Alvise) and Leo Minor (EVANGELVS SECUNDVS) 
 become EXTRA-zodiacal constellations, while they were of course 
 zodiacal in times when Pluto was officially a planet. Sitchinian 
 proposals taken into consideration, we have GAGA as Saturn's ex 
 satellite. Our zodiac reduces thus to 24 constellations, 25 in
 extension, conveniently splitting Serpens in two. 

 http://puck.dhs.org/extra/cetus Is your natal Moon in Cetus, too?

 Why Cetus? Because it is a _zodiacal_ constellation. Misconceptions
 have the zodiac a 12 constellation ring, when it is a 13 (Ophiucus!)
 constellation ring as concerns the Sun. The Sun journeys through
 13 constellations. But the Moon, Pluto and the planets journey
 through 28 constellations! This is largely out of reach for the
 practical (?) 12zodiacal (often "tropical") astrologer. This
 astrologer is _not_ concerned with the way things are (or were),
 he deals with unexisting positions, impossible conjunctions,
 immersed in a virtual simplified equinoctial model of the
 constellations, good enough for some old egyptian primary 
 school perhaps, but not good at all for serious research. 
 No wonder astronomers keep laughing at tropical astrologers:
 they deserve it in many ways. So do the siderealists and the 
 vedic. All of them refuse to take a simple glance at the sky.
 
 http://puck.dhs.org/28 http://puck.dhs.org/sedna in 12 houses

 Sedna is the protector of tritons, undines and evocational
 magick dealing with the watery element, especially while it
 still dives through Cetus. Watermonsters, krakens, lamias
 and sirens speak through dolphins and whales to the uninitiated.
 
    As concerns travel, it
    is obvious Sedna will bring the acolyte across to Avalon, 
    as not just long journeys, but actually journeys out of this
    world pertain to Sedna. Sedna's orbit alone dictates long
    distance communication as Sedna features in horoscopes of
    meditators, shamans and people who reside for a long time from
    home. Sedna will determine space mission captains in the
    future. Sedna liberates the meditator!                   Sedna
    is not perturbed (much) by the planets, and is almost untouched
    by sunrays, the better for the meditator to escape the ego-fires
    of the heart-Sun. The Sun is malefic in vedic tought, as the 
    Moon is truemind. The centripetal pull of the Sun and it's ego
    wishes symbolize (if not incorporate!) ego will (me, me!), but
    Sedna is (almost = savikalpa samadhi) liberated from the major
    gravitational basin, it is part of our system but fairly 
    with an "independent" (?) orbit. It is thus symbolized by the
    meditator in savikalpa samadhi.                 :::||| heart

 Sedna in Cetus in the 12 Astrological Horizon based Houses 

 (C) 2003 Klaudio Zic http://puck.dhs.org/sedna

 1. Insight. Balance. The Temple promotes longevity. Ancestral
    spirits help averting heart disease.

    Be extra careful with 6th and 7th house planets, as well as
    1st and 7th house placements as most astrological programs
    mistake the real positions, assuming the Sun rises in Due East.
    E.g. many of you have Neptune in 6th and not in 7th as the program
    shows. This is due to southern latutude and due western horizon.

 2. Astrologers will look for Sedna in the second house even in
    popular solar return charts! This is the best year one can
    have, finantially speaking. There's a hint at real eastate, 
    too. Talisman: the dollar, the Eye in the Triangle, Shiva.
 
    Windfall. The guru afloat on the sea. Sincerity. Good winds.
    Chopping wood for the winter. Cached wood carried to the stove.
    Storage. Resourceful? The maiden chops wood.

    Is Sedna Admetos? It could well be! It is not Phoebus of the
    Rathke Planets, but it perhaps qualifies as Admetos of the
    hamburgers. The last word is on Hamburg, of course.

  Get rich with horary $edna in the second house and savour the deep 
  sea taste of Sednastrology while Sedna is still in Cetus constellation!
    
 = New Planet Sedna in Finantial Astrology = http://puck.dhs.org

 Sedna has already a fair finantial record. Why does it influence
 the finantial $econd house of the horo$cope with such impetu$? 

    Hypoteticals such as the Avestans, Rathke Planets (see 
    under "darkplanets" on the site), and the Hamburg planets
    precede the recent discoveries. Admetos is favorable to
    stock exchange, much as 2002 AW197 is favorable to real estate.

  Is Sedna Admetos? It could well be! It is not Phoebus of the
  Rathke Planets, but it perhaps qualifies as Admetos of the

 /Adm/ Admetos is a hypotetical and as such lacks perspective.
       Sedna is a real object in Cetus, while hypotheticals
       seldom propose a declination and constellation.

       This leaves Admetos = Sedna as an interesting (or mere?)
       speculation. The second house effect is, nevertheless, 
       remarkable. Perhaps the two (?) work together?

 3. Inorganic being, but not as yet or necessary already or ever
    a helper. Non-human, but perhaps rather evil. Black packt. Easter.
    Do not travel to California, o.k. for New York (horary brief).

 4. Painful events in the family.

    The cusp of the 4th house is Nadir (not I.C.). This position is
    most important as it strikes Sedna's own family affairs. Her
    family then expands to all astral fauna. The shepardess of the
    astral dolphins is surely wounded hearted after the slaughter done
    to whales and dolphins. AVE MARIA STELLA MARIS. Sedna can be
    coupled with Santa Lucia in her inorganic aspect. This will be 
    done in Venice as summer gift to students ,readers and O5 classes.

 5. Good issue to steeling a wife. Stolen wife was not hidden (well)?
    Magus and Astrologer. Sexual pest. Burglary after enrichment?
    The unexpected Aiwass-like ward. FIAT LVX.
 
    The innocent magus is not supposed to hide an undine. He should
    marry her. Human heart knows vary few faiths and faithfulness
    can become a problem. The undine won't tollerate breaching and
    will demand the death of the magus, who will degrade into an
    astral underwater servant in Sedna worlds unimaginable to the

 6. Yato yato yami tato nrsimhah. Saint Marc's inorganic guide is
    Nrsimhah deva of the vedic lore, the protector of astral travel
    ers such as Prahlada Maharaj). Inner fires burning ego remanants. 
    Reguls as MIKAL. /a/ A fishing cat. Guru search out of the Temple.
    Out of the sea life crawls into the forest. Ancestral spirits lead
    to the wood-of-no-guru. Ancestral spirits spread the MariX before
    the initiate. The warp-and-woof of other life. Childbirth in the
    Temple. Capitalism. Sea ecology. Marine expeditions.

    Menkar can add up to fire hazard. Protect your stables. Take
    special care of your cats. Altars built to deal with fires.
    Vesta is especially interesting when dealing with 6th house 
    fire service and hazard. This position can "blow fire". The
    fiery element can be greatly stressed with Regulus acting
    on the planets in connection with Sedna here. 

    Note that we take the 6th house as being below the western
    horizon. That is never done in tropical/popular astrology. 

    Be extra careful with 6th and 7th house planets, as well as
    1st and 7th house placements as most astrological programs
    mistake the real positions, assuming the Sun rises in Due East.
    E.g. many of you have Neptune in 6th and not in 7th as the program
    shows. This is due to southern latutude and due western horizon.

 7. Sincere relationship and entwined souls. Super marriage!
    Mountain sisters? Twin souls? 

 Sedna's dolphins entwined are quite the opposite to the triurne 
 Lamia of 2004 DW. Aloof Sedna has much love, but 2004 DW is a
 dangerous siren. Luckily for the thick skinned magus, 2004 DW
 will bite only to die from the poisonous magician's blood.

    undine bride. various stories of sirens are in fact all true.
    
    One should be careful checking for latitude and horizon.
    When all is measured and checked out properly, there is
    no mistake and Sedna is _really_ in the 7th house! /b/

 </snip> <!-- See majikal initiation below -->

    When is a planet in the 7th house? When above the horizon.
    Checking Sedna in teh 7th house is especially tricky. Try
    and get some hints learning from othe people's errors here:
    http://puck.dhs.org/28 /extra /nu /dane.rudhyar /alan.leo
    The article is "7th House Switch" http://puck.dhs.org/nu

    Sedna is otherwise in the 6th house. Your astological
    program does not know it. This is an old standard error 
    of popular astrology for the masses. Many authors have
    their planets e.g. in the 12th when they're clearly in
    1st, having the appropriate latitude and position under
    the eastern horizon. The ascendant is Due East, of course.

 8. Time pyramind. Errection. Sinking. Sea bottom. The flood. 
    The overflooding well. 

 9. Excellent for art and travel! Roundabout. Spring equinox.
    Compare with Pegasus constellation. As concerns travel, it
    is obvious Sedna will bring the acolyte across to Avalon, 
    as not just long journeys, but actually journeys out of this
    world pertain to Sedna. Sedna's orbit alone dictates long
    distance communication as Sedna features in horoscopes of
    meditators, shamans and people who reside a long time from
    home. Sedna will determine space mission captains in the
    future. 

    Travel expands to second attention or waking up in one's dreams.
    Still better, Sedna at in 9th liberates the meditator! Sedna
    is not perturbed (much) by the planets, and is almost untouched
    by sunrays, the better for the meditator to escape the ego-fires
    of the heart-Sun. The Sun is malefic in vedic tought, as the 
    Moon is truemind. The centripetal pull of the Sun and it's ego
    wishes symbolize (if not incorporate!) ego will (me, me!), but
    Sedna is (almost = savikalpa samadhi) liberated from the major
    gravitational basin, it is part of our system but fairly 
    with an "independent" (?) orbit. It is thus symbolized by the

    Since Sedna is fairly removed from most interplanetary disputes,
    it must be consulted as a fair judge over the petty gravitational
    matters closer to us. Astrologers either consult the centaurs,
    which are perturbed by various planets, or the aloof world of
    the transneptunians. But how can 2004 DW judge? Is Quaoar fair?
    Nessus is too disturbed to do any judgement, and Asbolus, albeit
    magus, has not as yet seen it all. The centaurs lack perspective
    as they're thrown here and there by influences and planetary
    gravitation. The centaurs are our close dark archangels, but
    they are unable to encompass and judge creation. Only Sedna
    is capable of impartial empathy towards the centaurs and 
    transneptunian cubewano, plutino (and SDO) objects.

    Sedna in 11th 10th and 9th house and especially at the meridian 
    is a fair judge judging nothing, an aloof observer, the witness.
    Om sakshi aham. I am the Witness separate of all.

10. Grail. ( Crater ? ). Flying? One year of good business?
    Friends forever? Spirit helpers. Aiming at immortality after
    meeting a spiritual ancestor and guide. Persist in poverty.

    Space mission captain.
    
    Menkar is not traditionally goood at all at the meridian and 
    Sedna has been coupled with Alpha Ceti for a while. Speaking
    of coupling, Venus rises with Sedna at his time.

11. Wartime. Ra-Hoor-Khuit? The evil fixation of second attention.
    Visiting the feudal lord. Bribing the nagual?

12. Bad issue? Hidden victory? Quickly out of the Temple? The Temple
    of the Fast Redemption. O5. Chief druid. The Pope in Sicily. 
    The kayak. Niagara Falls. Transilvania Waterfalls.

    The 1st, 6th and 12th houses are most certainly connected to
    marine ecology, the sea and a sort of initiation. See also
    Varuna delineation. The first house is like the song of the
    old sea, the 6th enmeshes sea's secrets and is dangerous.
    Fire at the sea bottom? The 12th house is like the release
    from the sea, shooting up and forth, killing the raven of time.
 
    Sedna strangely wards off large animals, albeit near by Menkar
    attracts them. No large or wild animal will harm, but hazard
    seems imminent and rather obvious. Risky circuswork pays off.

    Animals are often demons. adam gave the names to all of the demons.
    
    Be extra careful with 6th and 7th house planets, as well as
    1st and 7th house placements as most astrological programs
    mistake the real positions, assuming the Sun rises in Due East.
    E.g. many of you have Neptune in 6th and not in 7th as the program
    shows. This is due to southern latutude and due western horizon.

    We don't suppose the house Franz Bardon has his own Sedna in,
    as we introduce it here for the sake of record. Sedna is overaspected
    in the magus incarnation horoscope but it is most remarkably the
    Saturn Mars midpoint as it seems responsable for the magician's
    captivity. Namely the nazi and a black lodge succeeded in torturing
    the magus. This is a complex subject and horoscope I must leave
    to more expert times. http://puck.dhs.org/sedna frabato

    Frabato's supposed troubles with the undines and watery element
    had a happy ending after dire danger. The depths are there to teach.

 One should not be misled by non-astrologers who "think" Sedna is in
 Taurus. It will slip in Taurus from Cetus in a couple of years (up
 coming article, coupling Venus' approach to Hydra and 2004 DW).

Sedna   531.657634 0.857434  11.9304 144.4929 311.8271 53200.5 357.8815

 Sedna is of course delineated in Cetus. It happens that 2004 DW 
 is in Hydra, Quaoar in Ophiucus and so on. All this constellations
 are not only ascendantal, they're also zodiacal. http://puck.dhs.org/28
