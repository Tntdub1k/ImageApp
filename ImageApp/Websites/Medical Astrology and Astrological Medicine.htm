      as applied to medicine has very ancient roots, for example in India, China
      and Egypt, but it reached its fullest flowering in Europe in the late
      medieval and early modern periods, c1450-1700. The influence of astrology
      also entered European medicine from the Arab countries. Basically it is no
      exaggeration to say that astrology dominated everything during that period
      and thus many systems of knowledge depended upon it, were symbiotic with
      it, or made reference to it in their worldview. In the case of medicine,
      astrologers assigned signs of the zodiac to rule over parts of the body,
      planets to rule over organs and systems, and planets to rule over diseases
      and drugs. Thus the whole system is one of observation and interpretation
      based upon a complex system of given Rulerships.<br>
      <br>
      This is clearly shown by Dygges in his 1555 manuscript:<br>

      <br>
      Brain and Nerves by Mercury [and Uranus]<br>
      Respiratory by Mercury<br>
      Heart by the Sun<br>
      Arteries by Mars<br>

      The energies are often in excess of the nervous and mental balance, and
      most ill-health has its origins in such things as violent exertion and
      outbursts of anger. The Aries person should seek poise at all costs.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Taurus</i> : Over-indulgence and too much comfort lie at the roots of
      most disorders, but there is also a tendency to brood over troubles which
      lends force to any passing ailments.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Gemini</i> : Nervous reactions and restlessness, form the basis.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Cancer</i> : Usually complaints originate in the emotions through some
      mental irritant, cause nervous reactions and general lessening of
      vitality. It has been said that nine times out of ten the Cancerian is
      hurt in health more by others than by himself.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Leo</i> : Nearly all afflictions tend to arise from over-exertion of
      some kind.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Virgo</i> : There is a tendency to upsets of the digestive organs from
      nervous causes, producing acidity and other troubles.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Libra</i> : Troubles arise usually from nervous exhaustion of some
      kind.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Scorpio</i> : Breaking down of the resistance through worrying and
      interaction of others upon the individual.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sagittarius</i> : Restlessness often causes the trouble; the folks
      under this Sign are peculiar to accidents and injuries.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Capricorn</i> : Disease is frequently rooted in inhibitions.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Aquarius</i> : Nervous causes, usually, based on the highly sensitive
      nature.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Pisces</i> : Over-heating of the mind with possibly fancied injuries
      from others, plus much sensitiveness physical and mental, form the basis
      for most complaints.<br>

      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>"The Vital spirit hath its residence in the
        heart, and is dispersed from it by the Arteries; and is governed by the
        influence of the Sun. And it is to the body, as the Sun is to the
        Creation: as the heart is in the Microcosm, so is the Sun in the
        Megacosm: for as the Sun gives life, light, and motion to the Creation,
        so doth did heart to the body; therefore it is called Sol Corporis, as
        the Sun is called Cor Coeli, because their operations are similar.<br>
        Inimical and destructive to this virtue, are Saturn and Mars. The Herbs
        and Plants of Sol, wonderfully fortify it.<br>
        Natural] The natural faculty or virtue resides in the liver, and is
        generally governed by Jupiter, Quasi Juvans Pater; its office is to
        nourish the body, and is dispersed through the body by the veins.<br>
        From this are bred four particular humours, Blood, Choler, Flegm and
        Melancholy.<br>
        <br>
        Blood is made of meat perfectly concocted, in quality hot and moist,
        governed by Jupiter It is by a third concoction transmuted into flesh,
        the superfluity of it into seed, and its receptacle is the veins, by
        which it is dispersed through the body.<br>
        <br>
        Choler is made of meat more than perfectly concocted; and it is the
        spume or froth of blood: it clarifies all the humours, heats the body,
        nourishes the apprehension, as blood doth the judgment. It is in quality
        hot and dry; fortifies the attractive faculty, as blood doth the
        digestive; moves man to activity and valour: its receptacle is the gall,
        and it is under the influence of Mars.<br>
        <br>
        Flegm is made of meat not perfectly digested; it fortifies the virtue
        expulsive, makes the body slippery, fit for ejection; it fortifies the
        brain by its consimilitude with it; yet it spoils apprehension by its
        antipathy to it. It qualifies choler, cools and moistens the heart
        thereby sustaining it, and the whole body, from the fiery effects which
        continual motion would produce. Its receptacle is the lungs, and is
        governed by Venus, some say by the Moon, perhaps it may be governed by
        them both, it is cold and moist in quality.<br>
        <br>
        Melancholy is the sediment of blood, cold and dry in quality' fortifying
        the retentive faculty, and memory; makes men sober solid, and staid, fit
        for study; stays the unbridled toys of lustful blood, stays the
        wandering thoughts, and reduces' them home to the Centre: its receptacle
        is in the spleen,: and it is governed by Saturn.<br>
        <br>
        Of all these humours blood is the chief, all the rest are superfluities
        of blood; yet are they necessary superfluities, for without any of them,
        man cannot live.<br>
        Namely; Choler is the fiery superfluities, Flegm, the Watery.

      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">On the one hand these Rulerships seem to be given as
      dogmas, on the other a certain logic can be perceived to underpin them.
      The characteristic features of the diseases or organs resonate with the
      features of the planets which rule them. Examples include the fluids ruled
      by the Moon or redness and heat by Mars. Thus, although the Rulerships are
      like fixed dogmas, they can be viewed as revealing an underlying logical
      pattern too.<br>
      <br>
      In ancient times, knowledge of the specific and general effects of
      medicinal compounds on health was very poorly understood compared with
      today, and was often based on the shape, colour, taste and texture of the
      material, before they were actually used medicinally. This was often
      referred to as the "doctrine of correspondences" [or
      "doctrine of signatures"]: a system which assumed that the
      Almighty had inscribed in the plants of the earth secret signs and
      features whereby their medicinal virtues could be ascer-tained by Man.
      Examples include yellow flowering plants for liver com-plaints, red and
      peppery herbs for fevers and haemorrhages, etc.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>"Lily of the valley...is under the dominion of
        mercury, and there-fore strengthens the brain, recruits a weak memory
        and makes it strong again." [Culpeper, 1652, p.149]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">Yet Convallaria [Lily of the Valley] has very few brain
      or 'mercur-ial' symptoms at all and is mainly used for heart conditions
      [ruled by Leo]. Drugs at that time were mainly employed on the basis of
      what today looks like a form of speculation and guesswork.<br>
      <br>
      For centuries, the medicinal qualities of a drug were decided by
      astrologi-cal considerations, such as reference to planetary rulers. For
      example, fruits, nuts and other nutritious or sweet-scented plants were
      deemed to be ruled by Venus; reddish and peppery plants by Mars; yellow or
      orange plants by Jupiter; dark, poisonous and bitter herbs were ruled by
      Saturn; silvery, white and watery [succulent] plants came under the Moon's
      rulership [see Culpeper].</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>"Paracelsus was also a firm believer in the
        doctrine of signatures, and in illustration of it explained every single
        part of St. John's Wort [Hypericum perforatum] in terms of this belief
        "...the holes in the leaves mean that this herb helps all inner and
        outer orifices of the skin...the blooms rot in the form of blood, a sign
        that it is good for wounds and should be used where flesh has to be
        treated." [Griggs, 1981, p.50]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">Most of the Herbal Materia Medica was, therefore,
      compiled by trial and error. Herbs were used on the basis of tradition, a
      semi-mythical method, stretching back in time before recorded history.
      This was the case in nearly all cultures on earth.<br>
      <br>
      Yet a surprising number of these herbal 'guesses' were apparently
      confirmed by the homeopathic provings. Examples include Chelidonium
      [Yellow Poppy] for liver complaints, Euphrasia [Eyebright] for eye
      complaints and Pulmonaria [Lungwort] for bronchitis. Presumably these
      properties were originally discovered from their clinical use rather than
      from 'signatures'.</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'Hahnemann definitely rejected [the law of
        signatures]... in his Materia Medica Pura we read under Chelidonium... '…the
        ancients imagined that the yellow colour of the juice of this plant was
        an indication (signature) of its utility in bilious diseases... the
        importance of human health does not admit of any such uncertain
        directions for the of medicines. It would be criminal frivolity to rest
        contented with such guesswork at the bedside of the sick.' ? [Hahnemann
        quoted in Hobhouse, pp.137-8]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">Most modern medical writers also regard all this
      astrology as bunk:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'Although early nineteenth century botanic medicine
        reveals little direct evidence of the 'doctrine of signatures' that had
        lain behind traditional herbalism, and that had expressed [as in the
        writings of Paracelsus] an interpenetrative holistic cosmology, indirect
        links are to be found in the literature's references to astrology, and
        in the pervasive quasi-hermetic references to vital force.' [Cooter,
        p.66]</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'It was a distinct advance, also, to divorce
        therapeutics from the astrological lore with which it had been long
        encumbered. The rationalism of medieval medicine could and did pass over
        at times into what appears to our modern eyes as mere superstition and
        mysticism; and the respect paid to astrology as late as the last half of
        the seventeenth century is an excellent example of this. One finds a
        royal physician in Paris solemnly proclaiming, in 1663, that astrology
        is absolutely essential to medical practice; and as late as 1688,
        another authority of that city published a book to defend the same
        thesis [Lussauld, 'Apologie pour les Medecins', Paris, 1663] After about
        1700, medical authorities paid less and less attention to such occult
        matters; no doubt because the development of Newtonian astronomy led
        most educated men to repudiate astrology altogether.' [Shryock,
        pp.59-60]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">Unfortunately for Shryock and his ilk, this argument
      very conveniently, and somewhat embarrassingly, ignores the fact that
      Newton himself was an ardent student of the occult, including astrology!</font></p>

      not!'.</i><br>
      <br>
      However, Shryock goes on:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'The general repudiation of astrology was
        significant, in that it indicated rejection of quasi-supernatural
        elements in medicine. This was necessary, as in all other fields, if the
        way was to be cleared for a truly 'natural' science.' [Shryock, 1936,
        p.60]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">And again:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'The chief accomplishment of the eighteenth-century
        thinkers...was the rejection of superstition and theology...in a word
        they cleared the way for the beginnings of a real social science - a
        service analogous to that performed by those who had earlier eliminated
        alchemy from chemistry, and astrology from medicine.' [Shryock, 1936,
        p.140]</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'Immensely popular at the time was astrological
        medicine which was prescribed by physician and quack alike. It was
        dominated by the ancient belief that human destiny was ruled by the
        stars, an attitude integral in the primitive approach to natural
        phenomena. In spite of its obvious pagan origins this doctrine has been
        tolerated by the Church and in the sixteenth century it still played a
        prominent role in medical thought. A curious extract from a letter of
        advice written by a physician in 1581 indicates the influence of this
        doctrine among medical 'scientists' of the day:<br>
        'On Friday and Saturday, the sign of the Zodiac shall be in the heart,
        on Sunday and Tuesday, in the stomach, during which time it will be safe
        dealing with physic preservative...' ' [Maple, 1968, pp.63-4]</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'Dr. John Dee [1527-1608], occultist, physician and
        astrologer, was yet a further example of the remarkable characters who
        then graced the upper ranks of quackery... besides acting as a medical
        adviser to Queen Elizabeth he was a dedicated necromancer and is
        reported to have conversed with a newly-resurrected corpse. His
        influence over the Queen was considerable and she actually sent her
        personal physician to attend him when he was ill...' [Maple, p.69]</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i><img src="./Medical Astrology and Astrological Medicine_files/dee3.jpg" width="227" height="310"><br>
        'Dee... wrote numerous works on logic, mathematics, astrology, alchemy,
        navigation,... but died in poverty... his eldest son, Arthur [1579-1651]
        was also an alchemist...' [Chamber's, p.399]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">Regarding the origins of the Black Death in Europe:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'When the learned physicians of the Medical Faculty
        in Paris looked for astrological confirmation... they found it: 'on 20
        March 1345, at 1pm, there occurred a conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter and
        Mars in the house of Aquarius...notoriously caused death and
        disaster...pestilence in the air...and calculated to draw up evil
        vapours from earth and water...' '[in Griggs, 1981, p.30]</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'Fracastorius [1483-1553] denied that Syphilis was
        introduced by Columbus...but was vague about its origins. It is carried
        by 'disease seeds' [semina morbum], is transmitted by contact [contages]
        or contagion, but is due ultimately to malign or poisonous astrological
        influences - the same combination of Mars and Saturn which had earlier
        brought the Black Death.' [Coulter, Vol. II, p.464]</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4"><img border="0" src="./Medical Astrology and Astrological Medicine_files/bills.jpg" align="right" width="261" height="353">In
      Paracelsan medicine, as Coulter notes, diseases '...are subject to
      astrological influence.' [Coulter, Vol. II, p.33]. Causes of disease are
      unquestioningly arrayed as to include '...poisons, unhealthy food,
      witches' spells, epidemic and astrological influences ['the blas of the
      stars'], etc...' [ibid., p.36]. Sydenham also speculated upon the array of
      unhealthy influences upon the human organism: '..the air is tainted, or
      whether the atmosphere be changed by some alterations induced by some
      peculiar conjunction of any of the heavenly bodies...' [ibid., p.199]. His
      theory of the human 'constitution' 'thus owed something to astrology and
      something to the corpuscular theory.' [ibid., p.200]. But Hahnemann, the
      founder of homeopathy rejected outright this ancient approach to medical
      science:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <p><font size="4"><i>'He has also rejected a priori methods relying on
        chemistry, botany, signatures, astrology, or physics...' [ibid., p.356].</i></font></p>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="4">The planets represent forces or energies at loose in the
      world; diseases are likewise represented by energies; thus a parallel
      became delineated and the one came to represent the other in this system.
      Diseases came to be seen and depicted very much as manifestations of these
      planetary energies. They shared the same qualities and attributes and thus
      could substitute for one another easily. This constitutes one of the
      fundamental foundations of medical astrology.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the medical astrologer was first to cast a chart for the
      patient's birth and another for the patient's disease or its approximate
      time of onset. From looking at these the astrologer could then determine
      any excess or deficient planetary energies which lay at the bottom of the
      problem. And a general prognosis could also be made at this stage. In
      effect the patient's problem is translated into astrological language and
      then its course and cure figured out from there.<br>
      <br>
      Drugs used were also classified under different planets and so excess
      energies could be cooled and neutralised by employing an appropriate drug;
      likewise deficient energies could be boosted by employing a drug which was
      known to stimulate that organ or system into better functioning. Drugs
      used were mainly of botanic origin but some minerals were also employed.
      The whole system attempts to harmonise and regularise the body functions
      by addressing certain organs and systems which are not working correctly.
      It is very like Acupuncture, Ayurveda and Chinese herbal medicine in its
      overall approach, in which a similar 'harmonisation of functioning' is the
      central therapeutic objective.<br>
      <br>
      Yet medical astrology soon became debased. It is a complex system which
      requires a great deal of time and thought to treat someone properly. By
      taking shortcuts and trimming the system, some bogus practitioners hoped
      to speed it up. This caused a debasement of the original system and thus
      it fell into disrepute along with astrology generally after the 1750s.
      Which is not to say that it didn't work or that it was useless, or that it
      was utterly without a rational basis.</font></p>
